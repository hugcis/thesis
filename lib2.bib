Our main result is a complete description of the landscape attached to E in terms of principal component analysis. We show that E has a unique minimum corresponding to the projection onto the subspace generated by the first principal vectors of a covariance matrix associated with the training patterns. All the additional critical points of E are saddle points (corresponding to projections onto subspaces generated by higher order vectors). The auto-associative case is examined in detail. Extensions and implications for the learning algorithms are discussed.},

  abstract = {Unpredictable patterns generated by cellular automata (CA) can be decomposed with respect to a turbulent, positive entropy rate pattern basis. The resulting filtered patterns uncover significant structural organization in a CA's dynamics and information processing capabilities. We illustrate the decomposition technique by analyzing a binary, range-2 cellular automaton having two invariant chaotic domains of different complexities and entropies. Once identified, the domains are seen to organize the CA's state space and to dominate its evolution. Starting from the domains' structures, we show how to construct a finite-state transducer that performs nonlinear spatial filtering such that the resulting space-time patterns reveal the domains and the intervening walls and dislocations. To show the statistical consequences of domain detection, we compare the entropy and complexity densities of each domain with the globally averaged quantities. A more graphical comparison uses difference patterns and difference plumes which trace the space-time influence of a single-site perturbation. We also investigate the diversity of walls and particles emanating from the interface between two adjacent domains.},

Filters of increasing sophistication are constructed for the efficient gathering of particle statistics and for the identification of higher-level defects, particle interactions, and secondary domains. We define the emergence time at which the space-time behavior condenses into configurations consisting only of domains, particles, and particle interactions.

  abstract = {An autoencoder network uses a set of recognition weights to convert an input vector into a code vector. It then uses a set of generative weights to convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input vector. We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The aim is to minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and the reconstruction error. We show that this information is minimized by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distribution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible code vector given the input vector. Unfortunately, if the code vectors use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors. We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder can be used to compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this approximation gives an upper bound on the description length. Even when this bound is poor, it can be used as a Lyapunov function for learning both the generative and the recognition weights. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to learn factorial codes.},

The learning procedures must be capable of modifying the connection strengths in such a way that internal units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain. Several interesting gradient-descent procedures have recently been discovered. Each connection computes the derivative, with respect to the connection strength, of a global measure of the error in the performance of the network. The strength is then adjusted in the direction that decreases the error. These relatively simple, gradient-descent learning procedures work well for small tasks and the new challenge is to find ways of improving their convergence rate and their generalization abilities so that they can be applied to larger, more realistic tasks.},

Using nearest neighbor, one-dimensional Cellular Automata (CA) as an example, we show how to construct local coarse-grained descriptions of CA in all classes of Wolfram's classification. The resulting coarse-grained CA that we construct are capable of emulating the large-scale behavior of the original systems without accounting for small-scale details. Several CA that can be coarse-grained by this construction are known to be universal Turing machines; they can emulate any CA or other computing devices and are therefore undecidable. We thus show that because in practice one only seeks coarse-grained information, complex physical systems can be predictable and even decidable at some level of description. The renormalization group flows that we construct induce a hierarchy of CA rules. This hierarchy agrees well with apparent rule complexity and is therefore a good candidate for a complexity measure and a classification method. Finally we argue that the large scale dynamics of CA can be very simple, at least when measured by the Kolmogorov complexity of the large scale update rule, and moreover exhibits a novel scaling law. We show that because of this large-scale simplicity, the probability of finding a coarse-grained description of CA approaches unity as one goes to increasingly coarser scales. We interpret this large scale simplicity as a pattern formation mechanism in which large scale patterns are forced upon the system by the simplicity of the rules that govern the large scale dynamics.},

It reduces superfluous \textendash{} microscopic \textendash{} degrees of freedom. Israeli and Goldenfeld demonstrated in [1,2] that the coarse-graining can be employed for elementary cellular automata (CA), producing interesting interdependences between them. However, extending their investigation on more complex CA rules appeared to be impossible due to the high computational complexity of the coarse-graining algorithm. We demonstrate here that this complexity can be substantially decreased. It allows for scrutinizing much broader class of cellular automata in terms of their coarse graining. By using our algorithm we found out that the ratio of the numbers of elementary CAs having coarse grained representation to ``degenerate'' \textendash{} irreducible \textendash{} cellular automata, strongly increases with increasing the ``grain'' size of the approximation procedure. This rises principal questions about the formal limits in modeling of realistic multiscale systems.},

A cell switches its state 0 to state 1 if one of its two neighbors is in state 1 (propagation of a perturbation) and a cell remains in state 1 only if its two neighbors are in state 0. A lateral inhibition is because a 1-state neighbor causes a 1-state cell to switch to state 0. The rule produces a rich spectrum of space-time dynamics, including gliders and glider guns just from four primitive gliders. We construct a catalogue of gliders and describe them by tiles. We calculate a subset of regular expressions \$\textbackslash Psi\_\{R54\}\$ to encode gliders. The regular expressions are derived from de Bruijn diagrams, tile-based representation of gliders, and cycle diagrams sometimes. We construct an abstract machine that recognizes regular expressions of gliders in rule 54 and validate \$\textbackslash Psi\_\{R54\}\$. We also propose a way to code initial configurations of gliders to depict any type of collision between the gliders and explore self-organization of gliders, formation of larger tiles, and soliton-like interactions of gliders and computable devices.},

  abstract = {Let L:=Z\^D be a D-dimensional lattice. Let A\^L be the Cantor space of L-indexed configurations in a finite alphabet A, with the natural L-action by shifts. A `cellular automaton' is a continuous, shift-commuting self-map F:A\^L--{$>$}A\^L. An `F-invariant subshift' is a closed, F-invariant and shift-invariant subset X of A\^L. Suppose x is an element of A\^L that is X-admissible everywhere except for some small region of L which we call a `defect'. Such defects are analogous to `domain boundaries' in a crystalline solid. It has been empirically observed that these defects persist under iteration of F, and often propagate like `particles' which coalesce or annihilate on contact. We use spectral theory to explain the persistence of some defects under F, and partly explain the outcomes of their collisions.},

  abstract = {Coherent structures form spontaneously in nonlinear spatiotemporal systems and are found at all spatial scales in natural phenomena from laboratory hydrodynamic flows and chemical reactions to ocean, atmosphere, and planetary climate dynamics. Phenomenologically, they appear as key components that organize the macroscopic behaviors in such systems. Despite a century of effort, they have eluded rigorous analysis and empirical prediction, with progress being made only recently. As a step in this, we present a formal theory of coherent structures in fully-discrete dynamical field theories. It builds on the notion of structure introduced by computational mechanics, generalizing it to a local spatiotemporal setting. The analysis' main tool employs the \textbackslash localstates, which are used to uncover a system's hidden spatiotemporal symmetries and which identify coherent structures as spatially-localized deviations from those symmetries. The approach is behavior-driven in the sense that it does not rely on directly analyzing spatiotemporal equations of motion, rather it considers only the spatiotemporal fields a system generates. As such, it offers an unsupervised approach to discover and describe coherent structures. We illustrate the approach by analyzing coherent structures generated by elementary cellular automata, comparing the results with an earlier, dynamic-invariant-set approach that decomposes fields into domains, particles, and particle interactions.},

  abstract = {Despite broad interest in self-organizing systems, there are few quantitative, experimentally-applicable criteria for self-organization. The existing criteria all give counter-intuitive results for important cases. In this Letter, we propose a new criterion, namely an internally-generated increase in the statistical complexity, the amount of information required for optimal prediction of the system's dynamics. We precisely define this complexity for spatially-extended dynamical systems, using the probabilistic ideas of mutual information and minimal sufficient statistics. This leads to a general method for predicting such systems, and a simple algorithm for estimating statistical complexity. The results of applying this algorithm to a class of models of excitable media (cyclic cellular automata) strongly support our proposal.},

  abstract = {Drawing on various notions from theoretical computer science, we present a novel numerical approach, motivated by the notion of algorithmic probability, to the problem of approximating the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity of short strings. The method is an alternative to the traditional lossless compression algorithms, which it may complement, the two being serviceable for different string lengths. We provide a thorough analysis for all binary strings of length and for most strings of length by running all Turing machines with 5 states and 2 symbols ( with reduction techniques) using the most standard formalism of Turing machines, used in for example the Busy Beaver problem. We address the question of stability and error estimation, the sensitivity of the continued application of the method for wider coverage and better accuracy, and provide statistical evidence suggesting robustness. As with compression algorithms, this work promises to deliver a range of applications, and to provide insight into the question of complexity calculation of finite (and short) strings. Additional material can be found at the Algorithmic Nature Group website at http://www.algorithmicnature.org. An Online Algorithmic Complexity Calculator implementing this technique and making the data available to the research community is accessible at http://www.complexitycalculator.com.},

  abstract = {Cellular automata (CA) rules can be classified automatically for a spectrum of ordered, complex, and chaotic dynamics by a measure of the variance of input-entropy over time. Rules that support interacting gliders and related complex dynamics can be identified, giving an unlimited source for further study. The distribution of rule classes in rule-space can be shown. A byproduct of the method allows the automatic ``filtering'' of CA space-time patterns to show up gliders and related emergent configurations more clearly. The classification seems to correspond to our subjective judgment of space-time dynamics. There are also approximate correlations with global measures on convergence in attractor basins, characterized by the distribution of in-degree sizes in their branching structure, and to the rule parameter, Z. Based on computer experiments using the software Discrete Dynamics Lab (DDLab), this article explains the methods and presents results for 1D CA. \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {We propose a measure based upon the fundamental theoretical concept in algorithmic information theory that provides a natural approach to the problem of evaluating n-dimensional complexity by using an n-dimensional deterministic Turing machine. The technique is interesting because it provides a natural algorithmic process for symmetry breaking generating complex n-dimensional structures from perfectly symmetric and fully deterministic computational rules producing a distribution of patterns as described by algorithmic probability. Algorithmic probability also elegantly connects the frequency of occurrence of a pattern with its algorithmic complexity, hence effectively providing estimations to the complexity of the generated patterns. Experiments to validate estimations of algorithmic complexity based on these concepts are presented, showing that the measure is stable in the face of some changes in computational formalism and that results are in agreement with the results obtained using lossless compression algorithms when both methods overlap in their range of applicability. We then use the output frequency of the set of 2-dimensional Turing machines to classify the algorithmic complexity of the space-time evolutions of Elementary Cellular Automata.},
