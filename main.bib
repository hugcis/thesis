  abstract = {To test generalization ability of a class of deep neural networks, we randomly generate a large number of different rule sets for 2-D cellular automata (CA), based on John Conway’s Game of Life. Using these rules, we compute several trajectories for each CA instance. A deep convolutional encoder-decoder network with short and long range skip connections is trained on various generated CA trajectories to predict the next CA state given its previous states. Results show that the network is able to learn the rules of various, complex cellular automata and generalize to unseen configurations. To some extent, the network shows generalization to rule sets and neighborhood sizes that were not seen during the training at all.},

Depending primarily on the value of its non-linearity parameter, the logistic map exhibits a great variety of behavior, including stable states, cycling and periodical activity and the period doubling phenomenon that leads to high-order chaos. From the real data sequences, binary sequences are derived. Consecutive L bit sequences are given as input to a cellular automaton with the task to regenerate the subsequent L bits of the binary sequence in precisely L evolution steps. To perform this task a genetic algorithm is employed to evolve cellular automaton rules. Various complex binary sequences are examined, for a variety of initial values and a wide range of values of the non-linearity parameter. The proposed hybrid multiple-step-ahead prediction algorithm, based on a combination of genetic algorithms and cellular automata proved efficient and effective.},

  abstract = {Open-ended evolution (OEE) is relevant to a variety of biological, artificial and technological systems, but has been challenging to reproduce in silico. Most theoretical efforts focus on key aspects of open-ended evolution as it appears in biology. We recast the problem as a more general one in dynamical systems theory, providing simple criteria for open-ended evolution based on two hallmark features: unbounded evolution and innovation. We define unbounded evolution as patterns that are non-repeating within the expected Poincare recurrence time of an isolated system, and innovation as trajectories not observed in isolated systems. As a case study, we implement novel variants of cellular automata (CA) where the update rules are allowed to vary with time in three alternative ways. Each is capable of generating conditions for open-ended evolution, but vary in their ability to do so. We find that state-dependent dynamics, regarded as a hallmark of life, statistically out-performs other candidate mechanisms, and is the only mechanism to produce open-ended evolution in a scalable manner, essential to the notion of ongoing evolution. This analysis suggests a new framework for unifying mechanisms for generating OEE with features distinctive to life and its artifacts, with broad applicability to biological and artificial systems.},

  abstract = {A major conceptual step forward in understanding the logical architecture of living systems was advanced by von Neumann with his universal constructor, a physical device capable of self-reproduction. A necessary condition for a universal constructor to exist is that the laws of physics permit physical universality, such that any transformation (consistent with the laws of physics and availability of resources) can be caused to occur. While physical universality has been demonstrated in simple cellular automata models, so far these have not displayed a requisite feature of life—namely open-ended evolution—the explanation of which was also a prime motivator in von Neumann’s formulation of a universal constructor. Current examples of physical universality rely on reversible dynamical laws, whereas it is well-known that living processes are dissipative. Here we show that physical universality and open-ended dynamics should both be possible in irreversible dynamical systems if one entertains the possibility of state-dependent laws. We demonstrate with simple toy models how the accessibility of state space can yield open-ended trajectories, defined as trajectories that do not repeat within the expected Poincaré recurrence time and are not reproducible by an isolated system. We discuss implications for physical universality, or an approximation to it, as a foundational framework for developing a physics for life.},

This review provides a summary of the advances that led to the development of artificial life, its current research topics, and open problems and opportunities. We classify artificial life research into fourteen themes: origins of life, autonomy, self-organization, adaptation (including evolution, development, and learning), ecology, artificial societies, behavior, computational biology, artificial chemistries, information, living technology, art, and philosophy.

Despite non-convex optimization being NP-hard, simple algorithms -- often variants of stochastic gradient descent -- exhibit surprising effectiveness in fitting large neural networks in practice. We argue that neural network loss landscapes contain (nearly) a single basin, after accounting for all possible permutation symmetries of hidden units. We introduce three algorithms to permute the units of one model to bring them into alignment with units of a reference model. This transformation produces a functionally equivalent set of weights that lie in an approximately convex basin near the reference model. Experimentally, we demonstrate the single basin phenomenon across a variety of model architectures and datasets, including the first (to our knowledge) demonstration of zero-barrier linear mode connectivity between independently trained ResNet models on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Additionally, we identify intriguing phenomena relating model width and training time to mode connectivity across a variety of models and datasets. Finally, we discuss shortcomings of a single basin theory, including a counterexample to the linear mode connectivity hypothesis.},

In particular, it is unclear what dynamical patterns arise in trained RNNs, and how those patterns depend on the training dataset or task. This work addresses these questions in the context of a specific natural language processing task: text classification. Using tools from dynamical systems analysis, we study recurrent networks trained on a battery of both natural and synthetic text classification tasks. We find the dynamics of these trained RNNs to be both interpretable and lowdimensional. Specifically, across architectures and datasets, RNNs accumulate evidence for each class as they process the text, using a low-dimensional attractor manifold as the underlying mechanism. Moreover, the dimensionality and geometry of the attractor manifold are determined by the structure of the training dataset; in particular, we describe how simple word-count statistics computed on the training dataset can be used to predict these properties. Our observations span multiple architectures and datasets, reflecting a common mechanism RNNs employ to perform text classification. To the degree that integration of evidence towards a decision is a common computational primitive, this work lays the foundation for using dynamical systems techniques to study the inner workings of RNNs.},

Under these rules, spatio-temporal patterns are sensitively dependent on the collision processes of solitons, and other elementary excitations such as breathers, kinks, and nuclei. Patterns typically become randomized as collisions proceed. Turbulent states are realized after many collisions. The resulting global patterns can be classified by the types of elementary excitations they contain. In many turbulent states, the spectra reveal a long-range order with a k−v anomaly for k ⪡ 1. The irreversible process leading to turbulent equilibrium is characterized by the transient spectrum together with the Allan variance. The mean free motion of a soliton in the turbulent states is measured by the mutual information flow, and the information loss is shown to obey an inverse power law. The transient time to reach an attractor grows exponentially with system size, which suggests that in the thermodynamic limit soliton turbulence is not an attractor but rather a transient state.},

  abstract = {Building models that can be rapidly adapted to numerous tasks using only a handful of annotated examples is an open challenge for multimodal machine learning research. We introduce Flamingo, a family of Visual Language Models (VLM) with this ability. Flamingo models include key architectural innovations to: (i) bridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models, (ii) handle sequences of arbitrarily interleaved visual and textual data, and (iii) seamlessly ingest images or videos as inputs. Thanks to their flexibility, Flamingo models can be trained on large-scale multimodal web corpora containing arbitrarily interleaved text and images, which is key to endow them with in-context few-shot learning capabilities. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Flamingo models, exploring and measuring their ability to rapidly adapt to a variety of image and video understanding benchmarks. These include open-ended tasks such as visual question-answering, where the model is prompted with a question which it has to answer, captioning tasks, which evaluate the ability to describe a scene or an event, and close-ended tasks such as multiple choice visual question-answering. For tasks lying anywhere on this spectrum, we demonstrate that a single Flamingo model can achieve a new state of the art for few-shot learning, simply by prompting the model with task-specific examples. On many of these benchmarks, Flamingo actually surpasses the performance of models that are fine-tuned on thousands of times more task-specific data.},

  abstract = {It is difficult to program cellular automata. This is especially true when the desired computation requires global communication and global integration of information across great distances in the cellular space. Various human-written algorithms have appeared in the past two decades for the vexatious majority classification task for one-dimensional two-state cellular automata. This paper describes how genetic programming with automatically defined functions evolved a rule for this task with an accuracy of 82.326\%. This level of accuracy exceeds that of the original 1978 Gacs-Kurdyumov-Levin (GKL) rule, all other known human-written rules, and all other known rules produced by automated methods. The rule evolved by genetic programming is qualitatively different from all previous rules in that it employs a larger and more intricate repertoire of domains and particles to represent and communicate information across the cellular space.},

Such a simplification is necessary since the interactions between network structure and function are not well understood. Evolutionary computations, which include genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming, are population-based search methods that have shown promise in many similarly complex tasks. This paper argues that genetic algorithms are inappropriate for network acquisition and describes an evolutionary program, called GNARL, that simultaneously acquires both the structure and weights for recurrent networks. GNARL's empirical acquisition method allows for the emergence of complex behaviors and topologies that are potentially excluded by the artificial architectural constraints imposed in standard network induction methods.{$<>$}},

Recently, deep learning has produced remarkable results, but it can be hard to use in practice, as its training requires large datasets and special-purpose and energy-consuming hardware. In this work, we propose a photonic hardware approach. Our experimental set-up comprises off-the-shelf components and implements an easy-to-train recurrent neural network with 16,384 nodes, scalable to hundreds of thousands of nodes. The system, based on the reservoir computing paradigm, is trained to recognize six human actions from the KTH video database using either raw frames as inputs or a set of features extracted with the histograms of an oriented gradients algorithm. We report a classification accuracy of 91.3\%, comparable to state-of-the-art digital implementations, while promising a higher processing speed in comparison to the existing hardware approaches. Because of the massively parallel processing capabilities offered by photonic architectures, we anticipate that this work will pave the way towards simply reconfigurable and energy-efficient solutions for real-time video processing.},

Constraints occur naturally in many data cleaning domains and can improve the quality of deduplication. An example of a constraint is “each paper has a unique publication venue”; if two paper references are duplicates, then their associated conference references must be duplicates as well. Our framework supports collective deduplication, meaning that we can dedupe both paper references and conference references collectively in the example above. Our framework is based on a simple declarative Datalogstyle language with precise semantics. Most previous work on deduplication either ignore constraints or use them in an ad-hoc domain-specific manner. We also present efficient algorithms to support the framework. Our algorithms have precise theoretical guarantees for a large subclass of our framework. We show, using a prototype implementation, that our algorithms scale to very large datasets. We provide thorough experimental results over real-world data demonstrating the utility of our framework for high-quality and scalable deduplication.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to train computers to perform a variety of complex tasks and improve with experience. Computers learn how to recognize patterns, make unintended decisions, or react to a dynamic environment. Certain trained machines may be more effective than others because they are based on more suitable ML algorithms or because they were trained through superior training sets. Although ML algorithms are known and publicly released, training sets may not be reasonably ascertainable and, indeed, may be guarded as trade secrets. While much research has been performed about the privacy of the elements of training sets, in this paper we focus our attention on ML classifiers and on the statistical information that can be unconsciously or maliciously revealed from them. We show that it is possible to infer unexpected but useful information from ML classifiers. In particular, we build a novel meta-classifier and train it to hack other classifiers, obtaining meaningful information about their training sets. This kind of information leakage can be exploited, for example, by a vendor to build more effective classifiers or to simply acquire trade secrets from a competitor’s apparatus, potentially violating its intellectual property rights.},

Recent frameworks address this bottleneck with generative models to synthesize labels at scale from weak supervision sources. The generative model's dependency structure directly affects the quality of the estimated labels, but selecting a structure automatically without any labeled data is a distinct challenge. We propose a structure estimation method that maximizes the l-regularized marginal pseudolikelihood of the observed data. Our analysis shows that the amount of unlabeled data required to identify the true structure scales sublinearly in the number of possible dependencies for a broad class of models. Simulations show that our method is 100 times faster than a maximum likelihood approach and selects 1/4 as many extraneous dependencies. We also show that our method provides an average of 1.5 F1 points of improvement over existing, user-developed information extraction applications on real-world data such as PubMed journal abstracts.},

The former viewpoint yields insight into the extent of the affected region, whereas the latter tells us something about the intensity of the defect propagation. In this paper, we will show how these viewpoints can be united by relying on Lyapunov profiles of CAs.},

We investigate this possibility in a polymer chemistry with catalysed cleavage and condensation reactions, studying the properties of a well-stirred reactor driven away from equilibrium by the flow of mass. Near equilibrium the distribution of material is uninteresting; it favours short polymers but is otherwise homogenous. However, under appropriate non-equilibrium conditions, the situation changes radically: The nonlinear feedback of the reaction network focuses the material of the system into a few specific polymer species, whose concentrations can be orders of magnitude about the background. Like a metabolism, the network of catalytic reactions "digests" the material of its environment, incorporating it into its own form. For this reason we call it an autocatalytic metabolism. We vary the diet of an autocatalytic metabolism, and demonstrate that under some variations it persists almost unchanged, while in other cases it dies. We argue that the dynamical stability of autocatalytic metabolisms gives them regenerative properties that allow them to repair themselves and to propagate through time.}

  abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

  abstract = {An important long-term goal in machine learning systems is to build learning agents that, like humans, can learn many tasks over their lifetime, and moreover use information from these tasks to improve their ability to do so efficiently. In this work, our goal is to provide new theoretical insights into the potential of this paradigm. In particular, we propose a lifelong learning framework that adheres to a novel notion of resource efficiency that is critical in many real-world domains where feature evaluations are costly. That is, our learner aims to reuse information from previously learned related tasks to learn future tasks in a feature-efficient manner. Furthermore, we consider novel combinatorial ways in which learning tasks can relate. Specifically, we design lifelong learning algorithms for two structurally different and widely used families of target functions: decision trees/lists and monomials/polynomials. We also provide strong feature-efficiency guarantees for these algorithms; in fact, we show that in order to learn future targets, we need only slightly more feature evaluations per training example than what is needed to predict on an arbitrary example using those targets. We also provide algorithms with guarantees in an agnostic model where not all the targets are related to each other. Finally, we also provide lower bounds on the performance of a lifelong learner in these models, which are in fact tight under some conditions.},

  abstract = {The classification of time series is a central problem in a wide range of disciplines. In this field, the state-of-the-art algorithm is COTE (Collective of Transformation-Based Ensembles) which is a combination of classifiers of different domains: time, autocorrelation, power spectrum and shapelets. The weakest point of this approach is its high computational burden which prevents its use in massive data environments. Shapelet Transform is one of the multiple algorithms that compose this ensemble. It has been shown to achieve a good performance over many reference datasets. Nevertheless, its computational complexity is also too high to be used in massive data environments. On the other hand, Big Data has emerged as an approach to manage massive datasets, which also applies to time series. We propose an algorithm for time series classification in a Big Data environment, DFST. It is based on a combination of the FastShapelet and Shapelet Transform ideas and it is the first completely scalable algorithm for time series classification. We have shown that our proposal scales linearly with the number of time series in dataset. In addition, the classification accuracy is equal to or higher than that of comparable sequential algorithms.},

Winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his role in fighting global hunger, Borlaug, an American agricultural scientist and plant breeder who worked for the Rockefeller Foundation, left a legacy that divides opinions even today. His high-yielding dwarf wheat varieties, known as miracle seeds, effectively doubled and tripled crop yields across the globe, from Kenya to India and Argentina to Mexico due to their wide adaptation. But these modern seeds also required expensive chemical fertilizers and irrigation, both of which were only available to wealthier farmers. Baranski argues that Borlaug's new technologies ultimately privileged wealthier farmers, despite assurances to politicians that these new crops would thrive in diverse geographies and benefit all farmers. As large-scale monocultures replaced traditional farming practices, these changes were codified into the Indian wheat research system, thus limiting attention to traditional practices and marginal environments. In the shadow of this legacy, and in the face of accelerating climate change, Baranski brings new light to Borlaug's role in a controversial concept in agricultural science"--},

However, regardless of the fact that users authoritativeness, expertise, trust and influence are evidently topic-dependent, the research on social influence has surprisingly largely overlooked this aspect. In this article, we study social influence from a topic modeling perspective. We introduce novel topic-aware influence-driven propagation models that, as we show in our experiments, are more accurate in describing real-world cascades than the standard (i.e., topic-blind) propagation models studied in the literature. In particular, we first propose simple topic-aware extensions of the well-known Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold models. However, these propagation models have a very large number of parameters which could lead to overfitting. Therefore, we propose a different approach explicitly modeling authoritativeness, influence and relevance under a topic-aware perspective. Instead of considering user-to-user influence, the proposed model focuses on user authoritativeness and interests in a topic, leading to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters of the model. We devise methods to learn the parameters of the models from a data set of past propagations. Our experimentation confirms the high accuracy of the proposed models and learning schemes.},

In this paper, we propose a new evaluation framework (TweetEval) consisting of seven heterogeneous Twitter-specific classification tasks. We also provide a strong set of baselines as starting point, and compare different language modeling pre-training strategies. Our initial experiments show the effectiveness of starting off with existing pre-trained generic language models, and continue training them on Twitter corpora.},

It is shown that feedforward networks with one layer of sigmoidal nonlinearities achieve integrated squared error of order O(1/n), where n is the number of nodes. The approximated function is assumed to have a bound on the first moment of the magnitude distribution of the Fourier transform. The nonlinear parameters associated with the sigmoidal nodes, as well as the parameters of linear combination, are adjusted in the approximation. In contrast, it is shown that for series expansions with n terms, in which only the parameters of linear combination are adjusted, the integrated squared approximation error cannot be made smaller than order 1/n/sup 2/d/ uniformly for functions satisfying the same smoothness assumption, where d is the dimension of the input to the function.

Much work has gone towards preventing the default tendency of machine learning models to catastrophically forget, yet virtually all such work involves manually-designed solutions to the problem. We instead advocate meta-learning a solution to catastrophic forgetting, allowing AI to learn to continually learn. Inspired by neuromodulatory processes in the brain, we propose A Neuromodulated Meta-Learning Algorithm (ANML). It differentiates through a sequential learning process to meta-learn an activation-gating function that enables contextdependent selective activation within a deep neural network. Specifically, a neuromodulatory (NM) neural network gates the forward pass of another (otherwise normal) neural network called the prediction learning network (PLN). The NM network also thus indirectly controls selective plasticity (i.e. the backward pass of) the PLN. ANML enables continual learning without catastrophic forgetting at scale: it produces state-of-the-art continual learning performance, sequentially learning as many as 600 classes (over 9,000 SGD updates).},

Coordination of the agents’ movements is achieved through stigmergy. This principle, originally developed for the description of termite building behaviour, allows indirect communication between agents through sensing and modification of the local environment which determines the agents’ behaviour. The efficiency of the work was measured for groups of one to five robots working together. Group size is a critical factor. The mean time to accomplish the task decreases for one, two, and three robots respectively, then increases again for groups of four and five agents, due to an exponential increase in the number of interactions between robots which are time consuming and may eventually result in the destruction of existing clusters. We compare our results with those reported by Deneubourg et al. (1990) where similar clusters are observed in ant colonies, generated by the probabilistic behaviour of workers.},

  abstract = {We detect ongoing innovation in empirical data about human technological innovations. Ongoing technological innovation is a form of open-ended evolution, but it occurs in a nonbiological, cultural population that consists of actual technological innovations that exist in the real world. The change over time of this population of innovations seems to be quite open-ended. We take patented inventions as a proxy for technological innovations and mine public patent records for evidence of the ongoing emergence of technological innovations, and we compare two ways to detect it. One way detects the first instances of predefined patent pigeonholes, specifically the technology classes listed in the United States Patent Classification (USPC). The second way embeds patents in a high-dimensional semantic space and detects the emergence of new patent clusters. After analyzing hundreds of years of patent records, both methods detect the emergence of new kinds of technologies, but clusters are much better at detecting innovations that are unanticipated and undetected by USPC pigeonholes. Our clustering methods generalize to detect unanticipated innovations in other evolving populations that generate ongoing streams of digital data.},

By adopting an autopoietic perspective on a glider, the set of possible perturbations to it can be divided into destructive and nondestructive subsets. From a glider's reaction to each nondestructive perturbation, its cognitive domain is then mapped. In addition, the structure of a glider's possible knowledge of its immediate environment, and the way in which that knowledge is grounded in its constitution, are fully described. The notion of structural coupling is then explored by characterizing the paths of mutual perturbation that a glider and its environment can undergo. Finally, a simple example of a communicative interaction between two gliders is given. The article concludes with a discussion of the potential implications of this analysis for the enactive approach to cognition.},

Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in the modern machine learning practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should balance under-fitting and over-fitting: rich enough to express underlying structure in data, simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in the modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered over-fit, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners.},

Two rather different kinds of computing resources have been considered in the theory of computational complexity: static or definitional resources such as program size, and dynamic resources such as time and memory. Algorithmic information theory allows a static complexity or information content to be defined both for finite and for infinite objects, as the size in bits of the smallest program to computer the object on a standard universal computer. Finite strings, such as minimal programs, which are incompressible or nearly so are called algorithmically random.},

In particular, we calculate the critical boundary in parameter space where the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics takes place. Employing a recently developed framework for analyzing real-time computations, we show that only near the critical boundary can such networks perform complex computations on time series. Hence, this result strongly supports conjectures that dynamical systems that are capable of doing complex computational tasks should operate near the edge of chaos, that is, the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics.},

The analysis is based on a newly available data set containing the names of about 9,500 Russian servicemen killed in Ukraine from February to November 2022. The data set was collected by a team of volunteers from the social media and other available sources. There are large inequalities in the army mortality rates across Russian regions, with the highest mortality of soldiers originating from poor regions in Siberia and the Russian Far East and the lowest from Moscow and St.Petersburg. Some ethnic minority groups, in particular Buryats and Tuvans, are overrepresented among the fatalities, compared to their population share. Once regional inequalities are taken into account, ethnic gaps in mortality are reduced substantially. It is likely that ethnic fatality gaps are largely driven by socio-economic inequalities: young men in poorer regions see the career in the military as more attractive. The paper places these findings in the context of the previous research on inequalities in US military casualties.},

In this paper we address this issue and significantly bridge the gap between these two types of models. Throughout our empirical investigation we do not aim to necessarily propose a new method, but strive to identify a robust and effective recipe for making state-of-the-art large scale models affordable in practice. We demonstrate that, when performed correctly, knowledge distillation can be a powerful tool for reducing the size of large models without compromising their performance. In particular, we uncover that there are certain implicit design choices, which may drastically affect the effectiveness of distillation. Our key contribution is the explicit identification of these design choices, which were not previously articulated in the literature. We back up our findings by a comprehensive empirical study, demonstrate compelling results on a wide range of vision datasets and, in particular, obtain a state-of-the-art ResNet-50 model for ImageNet, which achieves 82.8\% top-1 accuracy.},

Classically, CAs are uniform. However, non-uniformity has also been introduced in update pattern, lattice structure, neighborhood dependency and local rule. In this survey, we tour to the various types of CAs introduced till date, the different characterization tools, the global behaviors of CAs, like universality, reversibility, dynamics etc. Special attention is given to non-uniformity in CAs and especially to non-uniform elementary CAs, which have been very useful in solving several real-life problems.},

  abstract = {The sorting operation is one of the most commonly used building blocks in computer programming. In machine learning, it is often used for robust statistics. However, seen as a function, it is piecewise linear and as a result includes many kinks where it is non-differentiable. More problematic is the related ranking operator, often used for order statistics and ranking metrics. It is a piecewise constant function, meaning that its derivatives are null or undefined. While numerous works have proposed differentiable proxies to sorting and ranking, they do not achieve the O(n log n) time complexity one would expect from sorting and ranking operations. In this paper, we propose the first differentiable sorting and ranking operators with O(n log n) time and O(n) space complexity. Our proposal in addition enjoys exact computation and differentiation. We achieve this feat by constructing differentiable operators as projections onto the permutahedron, the convex hull of permutations, and using a reduction to isotonic optimization. Empirically, we confirm that our approach is an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches and showcase two novel applications: differentiable Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and least trimmed squares.},

  abstract = {Entropic regularization is quickly emerging as a new standard in optimal transport (OT). It enables to cast the OT computation as a differentiable and unconstrained convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved using the Sinkhorn algorithm. However, entropy keeps the transportation plan strictly positive and therefore completely dense, unlike unregularized OT. This lack of sparsity can be problematic in applications where the transportation plan itself is of interest. In this paper, we explore regularizing the primal and dual OT formulations with a strongly convex term, which corresponds to relaxing the dual and primal constraints with smooth approximations. We show how to incorporate squared 2-norm and group lasso regularizations within that framework, leading to sparse and group-sparse transportation plans. On the theoretical side, we bound the approximation error introduced by regularizing the primal and dual formulations. Our results suggest that, for the regularized primal, the approximation error can often be smaller with squared 2-norm than with entropic regularization. We showcase our proposed framework on the task of color transfer.},

We extend the result to other simple networks. We also present a network for which training is hard but where switching to a more powerful representation makes training easier. These results suggest that those looking for perfect training algorithms cannot escape inherent computational difficulties just by considering only simple or very regular networks. They also suggest the importance, given a training problem, of finding an appropriate network and input encoding for that problem. It is left as an open problem to extend our result to nodes with nonlinear functions such as sigmoids.},

  abstract = {The cellular Potts model (CPM, a.k.a. Glazier–Graner–Hogeweg or GGH model) is a somewhat liberal extension of probabilistic cellular automata. The model is derived from the Ising and Potts models and represents biological cells as domains of CA-sites of the same state. A Hamiltonian energy is used to describe the balance of forces that the biological cells apply onto one another and their local environment. A Metropolis algorithm iteratively copies the state from one site into one of the adjacent sites, thus shifting the domain interfaces and moving the biological cells along the lattice. The approach is commonly used in applications of developmental biology, where the CPM often interacts with systems of ordinary-differential equations that model the intracellular chemical kinetics and partial-differential equations that model the extracellular chemical signal dynamics to constitute a hybrid and multiscale description of the biological system. In this chapter we will introduce the cellular Potts model and discuss its use in developmental biology, focusing on the development of blood vessels, a process called vascular morphogenesis. We will start by introducing a range of models focusing on uncovering the basic mechanisms of vascular morphogenesis: network formation and sprouting and then show how these models are extended with models of intracellular regulation and with interactions with the extracellular micro-environment. We then briefly review the integration of models of vascular morphogenesis in several examples of organ development in health and disease, including development, cancer, and age-related macular degeneration. We end by discussing the computational efficiency of the CPM and the available strategies for the validation of CPM-based simulation models.},

Roughly speaking, a system is a collection of interacting elements making up a whole such as, for instance, a mechanical clock. While many systems may be quite complicated, they are not necessarily considered to be complex. Today, most authors agree on the essential properties a system has to possess to be called complex. The ?rst section is devoted to the description of these properties. To interpret the time evolution of a system, scientists build up models, which are simpli?ed mathematical representations of the system. The exact purpose of a model and what its essential features should be is explained in the second section. The mathematical models that will be discussed in this book are dynami- 1 calsystems. A dynamical system is essentially a set of equations whose- lutiondescribesthe evolution,asafunction oftime, ofthe state ofthe system. There exist di?erent types of dynamical systems.

Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

  abstract = {Machine learning has become a widely popular and successful paradigm, especially in data-driven science and engineering. A major application problem is data-driven forecasting of future states from a complex dynamical system. Artificial neural networks have evolved as a clear leader among many machine learning approaches, and recurrent neural networks are considered to be particularly well suited for forecasting dynamical systems. In this setting, the echo-state networks or reservoir computers (RCs) have emerged for their simplicity and computational complexity advantages. Instead of a fully trained network, an RC trains only readout weights by a simple, efficient least squares method. What is perhaps quite surprising is that nonetheless, an RC succeeds in making high quality forecasts, competitively with more intensively trained methods, even if not the leader. There remains an unanswered question as to why and how an RC works at all despite randomly selected weights. To this end, this work analyzes a further simplified RC, where the internal activation function is an identity function. Our simplification is not presented for the sake of tuning or improving an RC, but rather for the sake of analysis of what we take to be the surprise being not that it does not work better, but that such random methods work at all. We explicitly connect the RC with linear activation and linear readout to well developed time-series literature on vector autoregressive (VAR) averages that includes theorems on representability through the Wold theorem, which already performs reasonably for short-term forecasts. In the case of a linear activation and now popular quadratic readout RC, we explicitly connect to a nonlinear VAR, which performs quite well. Furthermore, we associate this paradigm to the now widely popular dynamic mode decomposition; thus, these three are in a sense different faces of the same thing. We illustrate our observations in terms of popular benchmark examples including Mackey-Glass differential delay equations and the Lorenz63 system.},

Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases. Besides, it can be successfully trained on a large scale data set with 1M entities, 25k relationships and more than 17M training samples.}

Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations.},

  abstract = {Can we use machine learning to compress graph data? The absence of ordering in graphs poses a significant challenge to conventional compression algorithms, limiting their attainable gains as well as their ability to discover relevant patterns. On the other hand, most graph compression approaches rely on domain-dependent handcrafted representations and cannot adapt to different underlying graph distributions. This work aims to establish the necessary principles a lossless graph compression method should follow to approach the entropy storage lower bound. Instead of making rigid assumptions about the graph distribution, we formulate the compressor as a probabilistic model that can be learned from data and generalise to unseen instances. Our “Partition and Code” framework entails three steps: first, a partitioning algorithm decomposes the graph into elementary structures, then these are mapped to the elements of a small dictionary on which we learn a probability distribution, and finally, an entropy encoder translates the representation into bits. All three steps are parametric and can be trained with gradient descent. We theoretically compare the compression quality of several graph encodings and prove, under mild conditions, a total ordering of their expected description lengths. Moreover, we show that, under the same conditions, PnC achieves compression gains w.r.t. the baselines that grow either linearly or quadratically with the number of vertices. Our algorithms are quantitatively evaluated on diverse real-world networks obtaining significant performance improvements with respect to different families of non-parametric and parametric graph compressors.},

While previous approximation results are valid over finite time intervals and for signals in compact sets, the approximations presented here hold for all time and for signals in useful (noncompact) sets. The discretetime analog of the second theorem asserts that any TI operator with fading memory can be approximated (in our strong sense) by a nonlinear moving- average operator.

  abstract = {Minimal Criterion Coevolution (MCC) is a recently-introduced algorithm that demonstrates how interactions between two populations, each subject to a simple reproductive constraint, can produce an open-ended search process. Unlike conventional quality diversity (QD) algorithms, which also promote divergence, MCC does not require an explicit characterization of behavior or a comparison of performance, thereby addressing bottlenecks introduced by an intrinsically-finite behavior descriptor and by an assessment of comparative quality. Genetic speciation, a common method of diversity preservation, maintains population diversity in MCC; however, it requires an unnatural explicit comparison of genetic similarity. In nature, organisms are implicitly segregated into niches that each have a carrying capacity dictated by the amount of available resources. To show that MCC can be simpler and more natural while still working effectively, this paper introduces a method of diversity preservation through resource limitation, thereby alleviating the need to formalize and compare genetic distance. Experimental results in a maze navigation domain demonstrate that resource limitation not only maintains higher population diversity in both the maze and agent populations, but also accelerates evolution by forcing individuals to explore new niches, thereby suggesting that resource limitation is an effective, simpler, and more natural alternative for diversity preservation in MCC.},

When intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and action, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporateeverything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

This curse threatens countries whose economies are poorly diversified and oriented mainly towards the export of their non-renewable natural resources, such as oil. What about the exploitation of an abundant renewable natural resource such as solar energy? Based on a case study of six solar power plants in six African countries (Burkina Faso, Madagascar, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, and South Africa), this paper analyzes the extent to which the impacts of the exploitation of these energy systems contribute to this curse. The research method is qualitative (296 interviews) and quantitative (use of a sustainability index), making it possible to analyze the impacts of solar power plants on four levels (local, regional, national, and international). Our results reveal four findings symptomatic of the resource curse: (i) the emergence of conflict situations, (ii) fragile local development, (iii) latent financial risk, and (iv) limited economic development leverage. In short, the resource curse linked to the use of renewable energies seems to bring another challenge to the landscape of energy transition.},

However, annotating each environment with hand-designed, dense rewards is not scalable, motivating the need for developing reward functions that are intrinsic to the agent. Curiosity is a type of intrinsic reward function which uses prediction error as reward signal. In this paper: (a) We perform the first large-scale study of purely curiosity-driven learning, i.e. without any extrinsic rewards, across 54 standard benchmark environments, including the Atari game suite. Our results show surprisingly good performance, and a high degree of alignment between the intrinsic curiosity objective and the handdesigned extrinsic rewards of many game environments. (b) We investigate the effect of using different feature spaces for computing prediction error and show that random features are sufficient for many popular RL game benchmarks, but learned features appear to generalize better (e.g. to novel game levels in Super Mario Bros.).

  abstract = {A paintable computer is defined as an agglomerate of numerous, finely dispersed, ultra-miniaturized computing particles; each positioned randomly, running asynchronously and communicating locally. Individual particles are tightly resource bound, and processing is necessarily distributed. Yet computing elements are vanishingly cheap and are regarded as freely expendable. In this regime, a limiting problem is the distribution of processing over a particle ensemble whose topology can vary unexpectedly. The principles of material self-assembly are employed to guide the positioning of “process fragments”—autonomous, mobile pieces of a larger process. These fragments spatially position themselves and re-aggregate into a running process. We present the results of simulations to show that “process self-assembly” is viable, robust and supports a variety of useful applications on a paintable computer. We describe a hardware reference platform as an initial guide to the application domain. We describe a programming model which normatively defines the term process fragment and which provides environmental support for the fragment's mobility, scheduling and data exchange. The programming model is embodied in a simulator that supports development, test and visualization on a 2D particle ensemble. Experiments on simple combinations of fragments demonstrate robustness and explore the limits of scale invariance. Process fragments are shown interacting to approximate conservative fields, and using these fields to implement scaffolded and thermodynamic self-assembly. Four applications demonstrate practical relevance, delineate the application domain and collectively illustrate the paintable's capacity for storage, communication and signal processing. These four applications are Audio Streaming, Holistic Data Storage, Surface Bus and Image Segmentation. (Copies available exclusively from MIT Libraries, Rm. 14-0551, Cambridge, MA 02139-4307.

  abstract = {Reservoir computing is an approach to machine learning. Typical reservoir computing approaches use large, untrained artificial neural networks to transform an input signal. To produce the desired output, a readout layer is trained using linear regression on the neural network. Recently, several attempts have been made using other kinds of dynamic systems instead of artificial neural networks. Cellular automata are an example of a dynamic sys- tem that has been proposed as a replacement.- This thesis attempts to discover whether cellular automata are a viable candidate for use in reservoir computing. Four different tasks solved by other reservoir computing sys- tems are attempted with elementary cellular automata, a limited subset of all possible cellular automata. The effect of changing different properties of the cellular automata are investigated, and the results are compared with the results when performing the same experiments with typical reservoir computing systems. Reservoir computing seems like a potentially very interesting utilization of cellular automata. However, it is evident that more research into this field is necessary to reach performance comparable to existing reservoir computing systems.},

Differentiable NAS can reduce the cost of GPU hours via a continuous representation of network architecture but suffers from the high GPU memory consumption issue (grow linearly w.r.t. candidate set size). As a result, they need to utilize\textasciitilde\textbackslash emph\{proxy\} tasks, such as training on a smaller dataset, or learning with only a few blocks, or training just for a few epochs. These architectures optimized on proxy tasks are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task. In this paper, we present \textbackslash emph\{ProxylessNAS\} that can \textbackslash emph\{directly\} learn the architectures for large-scale target tasks and target hardware platforms. We address the high memory consumption issue of differentiable NAS and reduce the computational cost (GPU hours and GPU memory) to the same level of regular training while still allowing a large candidate set. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of directness and specialization. On CIFAR-10, our model achieves 2.08\textbackslash\% test error with only 5.7M parameters, better than the previous state-of-the-art architecture AmoebaNet-B, while using 6\$\textbackslash times\$ fewer parameters. On ImageNet, our model achieves 3.1\textbackslash\% better top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2, while being 1.2\$\textbackslash times\$ faster with measured GPU latency. We also apply ProxylessNAS to specialize neural architectures for hardware with direct hardware metrics (e.g. latency) and provide insights for efficient CNN architecture design.},

  abstract = {In this article, the so-called ‘anti-woke’ culture war is deconstructed through the notions of metapolitics in fascist discourses – linked to the Gramscian ‘hegemonisation’ and ‘the war of position’ – as well as the Schmittian friend/enemy distinction coupled with theories of deviance and moral panics. The appropriation of the neo-fascist culture war discourse by the mainstream right in the UK is analysed discursively, combining political discourse analysis, the discourse-historical approach and discourse-conceptual analysis. The anti-woke culture war by the British conservative party as well as rightwing media will serve to analyse how social justice struggles like anti-racism, anti-sexism and pro-LGBTQ rights are being abnormalised and positioned as extreme deviant political positions. Linked to this, so-called ‘cancel culture’ is strategically deployed by dominant groups to neutralise contestations against racist, sexist and anti-LGBTQ views. Finally, freedom of speech and the right to offend is weaponised to protect racist and discriminatory language and to position these idea’s as valid opinions worthy of democratic debate.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f/spl isin/C/sup N/ and a randomly chosen set of frequencies /spl Omega/. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set /spl Omega/? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=/spl sigma//sub /spl tau//spl isin/T/f(/spl tau/)/spl delta/(t-/spl tau/) obeying |T|/spl les/C/sub M//spl middot/(log N)/sup -1/ /spl middot/ |/spl Omega/| for some constant C/sub M/{$>$}0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N/sup -M/), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the /spl lscr//sub 1/ minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for C/sub M/ which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|/spl middot/logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N/sup -M/) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|/spl middot/logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

These contrastive methods typically work online and rely on a large number of explicit pairwise feature comparisons, which is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, SwAV, that takes advantage of contrastive methods without requiring to compute pairwise comparisons. Specifically, our method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or views) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, we use a swapped prediction mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a view from the representation of another view. Our method can be trained with large and small batches and can scale to unlimited amounts of data. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method is more memory efficient since it does not require a large memory bank or a special momentum network. In addition, we also propose a new data augmentation strategy, multi-crop, that uses a mix of views with different resolutions in place of two full-resolution views, without increasing the memory or compute requirements much. We validate our findings by achieving 75.3\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, as well as surpassing supervised pretraining on all the considered transfer tasks.},

First, through a field study with 18 service providers, we uncover that most service providers do not have any privacy policy or controls to safeguard device owners' personal data from snooping by technicians. Second, we drop rigged devices for repair at 16 service providers and collect data on widespread privacy violations by technicians, including snooping on personal data, copying data off the device, and removing tracks of snooping activities. Third, we conduct an online survey (n=112) to collect data on customers' experiences when getting devices repaired. Fourth, we invite a subset of survey respondents (n=30) for semi-structured interviews to establish a deeper understanding of their experiences and identify potential solutions to curtail privacy violations by technicians. We apply our findings to discuss possible controls and actions different stakeholders and regulatory agencies should take to improve the state of privacy in the repair industry.},

Recent research suggests event schemas can be learned from raw text. Inspired by a pipelined learner based on named entity coreference, this paper presents the first generative model for schema induction that integrates coreference chains into learning. Our generative model is conceptually simpler than the pipelined approach and requires far less training data. It also provides an interesting contrast with a recent HMM-based model. We evaluate on a common dataset for template schema extraction. Our generative model matches the pipeline’s performance, and outperforms the HMM by 7 F1 points (20\%).},

Our algorithm instead learns the template structure automatically from raw text, inducing template schemas as sets of linked events (e.g., bombings include detonate, set off, and destroy events) associated with semantic roles. We also solve the standard IE task, using the induced syntactic patterns to extract role fillers from specific documents. We evaluate on the MUC-4 terrorism dataset and show that we induce template structure very similar to handcreated gold structure, and we extract role fillers with an F1 score of .40, approaching the performance of algorithms that require full knowledge of the templates.},

As a secondary user (SU), a DSA device will face two critical problems: 1) avoiding causing harmful interference to primary users (PUs) and 2) conducting effective interference coordination with other SUs. These two problems become even more challenging for a distributed DSA network where there is no centralized controllers for SUs. In this paper, we investigate communication strategies of a distributive DSA network under the presence of spectrum sensing errors. To be specific, we apply the powerful machine learning tool, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), for SUs to learn “appropriate” spectrum access strategies in a distributed fashion assuming NO knowledge of the underlying system statistics. Furthermore, a special type of recurrent neural network, called the reservoir computing (RC), is utilized to realize DRL by taking advantage of the underlying temporal correlation of the DSA network. Using the introduced machine learning-based strategy, SUs could make spectrum access decisions distributedly relying only on their own current and past spectrum sensing outcomes. Through extensive experiments, our results suggest that the RC-based spectrum access strategy can help the SU to significantly reduce the chances of collision with PUs and other SUs. We also show that our scheme outperforms the myopic method which assumes the knowledge of system statistics, and converges faster than the Q-learning method when the number of channels is large.},

  abstract = {Self-replication is a key aspect of biological life that has been largely overlooked in Artificial Intelligence systems. Here we describe how to build and train self-replicating neural networks. The network replicates itself by learning to output its own weights. The network is designed using a loss function that can be optimized with either gradient-based or non-gradient-based methods. We also describe a method we call regeneration to train the network without explicit optimization, by injecting the network with predictions of its own parameters. The best solution for a self-replicating network was found by alternating between regeneration and optimization steps. Finally, we describe a design for a self-replicating neural network that can solve an auxiliary task such as MNIST image classification. We observe that there is a trade-off between the network's ability to classify images and its ability to replicate, but training is biased towards increasing its specialization at image classification at the expense of replication. This is analogous to the trade-off between reproduction and other tasks observed in nature. We suggest that a self-replication mechanism for artificial intelligence is useful because it introduces the possibility of continual improvement through natural selection.},

Multimodal optimization algorithms search for the highest peaks in the search space that can be more than one. Quality-Diversity algorithms are a recent addition to the evolutionary computation toolbox that do not only search for a single set of local optima, but instead try to illuminate the search space. In effect, they provide a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. The main differences with multimodal optimization algorithms are that (1) Quality-Diversity typically works in the behavioral space (or feature space), and not in the genotypic (or parameter) space, and (2) Quality-Diversity attempts to fill the whole behavior space, even if the niche is not a peak in the fitness landscape. In this chapter, we provide a gentle introduction to Quality-Diversity optimization, discuss the main representative algorithms, and the main current topics under consideration in the community. Throughout the chapter, we also discuss several successful applications of Quality-Diversity algorithms, including deep learning, robotics, and reinforcement learning.},

Our solution belongs to learning based methods, which have recently become popular to stylize images in artistic forms such as painting. However, existing methods do not produce satisfactory results for cartoonization, due to the fact that (1) cartoon styles have unique characteristics with high level simplification and abstraction, and (2) cartoon images tend to have clear edges, smooth color shading and relatively simple textures, which exhibit significant challenges for texture-descriptor-based loss functions used in existing methods. In this paper, we propose CartoonGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework for cartoon stylization. Our method takes unpaired photos and cartoon images for training, which is easy to use. Two novel losses suitable for cartoonization are proposed: (1) a semantic content loss, which is formulated as a sparse regularization in the high-level feature maps of the VGG network to cope with substantial style variation between photos and cartoons, and (2) an edge-promoting adversarial loss for preserving clear edges.  We further introduce an initialization phase, to improve the convergence of the network to the target manifold. Our method is also much more efficient to train than existing methods. Experimental results show that our method is able to generate high-quality cartoon images from real-world photos (i.e., following specific artists’ styles and with clear edges and smooth shading) and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return.

Inasmuch as related knowledge bases are built in several different languages, achieving cross-lingual knowledge alignment will help people in constructing a coherent knowledge base, and assist machines in dealing with different expressions of entity relationships across diverse human languages. Unfortunately, achieving this highly desirable crosslingual alignment by human labor is very costly and errorprone. Thus, we propose MTransE, a translation-based model for multilingual knowledge graph embeddings, to provide a simple and automated solution. By encoding entities and relations of each language in a separated embedding space, MTransE provides transitions for each embedding vector to its cross-lingual counterparts in other spaces, while preserving the functionalities of monolingual embeddings. We deploy three different techniques to represent cross-lingual transitions, namely axis calibration, translation vectors, and linear transformations, and derive five variants for MTransE using different loss functions. Our models can be trained on partially aligned graphs, where just a small portion of triples are aligned with their cross-lingual counterparts. The experiments on cross-lingual entity matching and triple-wise alignment verification show promising results, with some variants consistently outperforming others on different tasks. We also explore how MTransE preserves the key properties of its monolingual counterpart TransE.},

We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

Traditional mechanical metamaterials achieve functionalities such as a target Poisson’s ratio3 or shape transformation4–6 through unit-cell optimization7–9, often with spatial heterogeneity10–12. These functionalities are programmed into the layout of the metamaterial in a way that cannot be altered. Although recent efforts have produced means of tuning such properties post-fabrication13–19, they have not demonstrated mechanical reprogrammability analogous to that of digital devices, such as hard disk drives, in which each unit can be written to or read from in real time as required. Here we overcome this challenge by using a design framework for a tileable mechanical metamaterial with stable memory at the unit-cell level. Our design comprises an array of physical binary elements (m-bits), analogous to digital bits, with clearly delineated writing and reading phases. Each m-bit can be independently and reversibly switched between two stable states (acting as memory) using magnetic actuation to move between the equilibria of a bistable shell20–25. Under deformation, each state is associated with a distinctly different mechanical response that is fully elastic and can be reversibly cycled until the system is reprogrammed. Encoding a set of binary instructions onto the tiled array yields markedly different mechanical properties; specifically, the stiffness and strength can be made to range over an order of magnitude. We expect that the stable memory and on-demand reprogrammability of mechanical properties in this design paradigm will facilitate the development of advanced forms of mechanical metamaterials.},

The scalability of influence maximization is a key factor for enabling prevalent viral marketing in large-scale online social networks. Prior solutions, such as the greedy algorithm of Kempe et al. (2003) and its improvements are slow and not scalable, while other heuristic algorithms do not provide consistently good performance on influence spreads. In this paper, we design a new heuristic algorithm that is easily scalable to millions of nodes and edges in our experiments. Our algorithm has a simple tunable parameter for users to control the balance between the running time and the influence spread of the algorithm. Our results from extensive simulations on several real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate that our algorithm is currently the best scalable solution to the influence maximization problem: (a) our algorithm scales beyond million-sized graphs where the greedy algorithm becomes infeasible, and (b) in all size ranges, our algorithm performs consistently well in influence spread —it is always among the best algorithms, and in most cases it significantly outperforms all other scalable heuristics to as much as 100\%–260\% increase in influence spread.},

We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank.

We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50.

Such structures can be formalized by the notion of a frame (a.k.a. template), which comprises a set of related events and prototypical participants and event transitions. Identifying frames is a prerequisite for information extraction and natural language generation, and is usually done manually. Methods for inducing frames have been proposed recently, but they typically use ad hoc procedures and are difficult to diagnose or extend. In this paper, we propose the first probabilistic approach to frame induction, which incorporates frames, events, and participants as latent topics and learns those frame and event transitions that best explain the text. The number of frame components is inferred by a novel application of a split-merge method from syntactic parsing. In end-to-end evaluations from text to induced frames and extracted facts, our method produces state-of-the-art results while substantially reducing engineering effort.},

This is an idealization of the usual way to train neural networks with a large hidden layer. We show that, when initialized correctly and in the many-particle limit, this gradient flow, although non-convex, converges to global minimizers. The proof involves Wasserstein gradient flows, a by-product of optimal transport theory. Numerical experiments show that this asymptotic behavior is already at play for a reasonable number of particles, even in high dimension.},

  abstract = {This paper defines a new transport metric over the space of non-negative measures. This metric interpolates between the quadratic Wasserstein and the Fisher-Rao metrics and generalizes optimal transport to measures with different masses. It is defined as a generalization of the dynamical formulation of optimal transport of Benamou and Brenier, by introducing a source term in the continuity equation. The influence of this source term is measured using the Fisher-Rao metric, and is averaged with the transportation term. This gives rise to a convex variational problem defining our metric. Our first contribution is a proof of the existence of geodesics (i.e. solutions to this variational problem). We then show that (generalized) optimal transport and Fisher-Rao metrics are obtained as limiting cases of our metric. Our last theoretical contribution is a proof that geodesics between mixtures of sufficiently close Diracs are made of translating mixtures of Diracs. Lastly, we propose a numerical scheme making use of first order proximal splitting methods and we show an application of this new distance to image interpolation.},

  abstract = {Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model PaLM. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

In its first generation it not only had a worldwide span, in the area of computer modelling, for example, its proponents such as John von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, also came up with models and methods such as cellular automata and artificial neural networks, which are still the foundation of most modern modelling approaches. At the same time, cybernetics also got the attention of philosophers, such as the Frenchman Gilbert Simondon, who made use of cybernetical concepts in order to establish a metaphysics and a natural philosophy of individuation, giving cybernetics thereby a philosophical interpretation, which he baptised allagmatic. In this paper, we emphasise this allagmatic theory by showing how Simondon’s philosophical concepts can be used to formulate a generic computer model or metamodel for complex systems modelling and its implementation in program code, according to generic programming. We also present how the developed allagmatic metamodel is capable of building simple cellular automata and artificial neural networks.},

Cellular neural networks share the best features of both worlds: their continuous-time feature allows real-time signal processing, and their local interconnection feature makes them particularly adapted for VLSI implementation.

We subject a large number of autopoietic patterns in the Game of Life to various perturbations, and record their responses using multiple resilience metrics. Our results show that while resilience is rare, we are able to identify structural features improving patterns' resilience. We also draw several parallels between the resilience of patterns in the Game of Life to real-world complex systems.

  abstract = {We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method doesn’t use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a parameter-free, universal, similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or NCD , computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The NCD is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal. However, the optimality comes at the price of using the non-computable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose axioms to capture the real-world setting, and show that the NCD approximates optimality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (binary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.},

Understanding complex computations happening in cellular automata and other systems capable of emergence poses many challenges, especially in large-scale systems. We propose methods for coarse-graining cellular automata based on frequency analysis of cell states, clustering and autoencoders. These innovative techniques facilitate the discovery of large-scale structure formation and complexity analysis in those systems. They emphasize interesting behaviors in elementary cellular automata while filtering out background patterns. Moreover, our methods reduce large 2D automata to smaller sizes and enable identifying systems that behave interestingly at multiple scales.},

  abstract = {Perhaps the most ambitious scientific quest in human history is the creation of general artificial intelligence, which roughly means AI that is as smart or smarter than humans. The dominant approach in the machine learning community is to attempt to discover each of the pieces that might be required for intelligence, with the implicit assumption that at some point in the future some group will complete the Herculean task of figuring out how to combine all of those pieces into an extremely complex machine. I call this the “manual AI approach.” This paper describes another exciting path that ultimately may be more successful at producing general AI. It is based on the clear trend from the history of machine learning that hand-designed solutions eventually are replaced by more effective, learned solutions. The idea is to create an AI-generating algorithm (AI-GA), which itself automatically learns how to produce general AI. Three Pillars are essential for the approach: (1) meta-learning architectures, (2) meta-learning the learning algorithms themselves, and (3) generating effective learning environments. While work has begun on the first two pillars, little has been done on the third. Here I argue that either the manual or AI-GA approach could be the first to lead to general AI, and that both are worthwhile scientific endeavors irrespective of which is the fastest path. Because both approaches are roughly equally promising, and because the machine learning community is mostly committed to the engineered AI approach currently, I argue that our community should shift a substantial amount of its research investment to the AI-GA approach. To encourage such research, I describe promising work in each of the Three Pillars. I also discuss the safety and ethical considerations unique to the AI-GA approach. Because it it may be the fastest path to general AI and because it is inherently scientifically interesting to understand the conditions in which a simple algorithm can produce general AI (as happened on Earth where Darwinian evolution produced human intelligence), I argue that the pursuit of AI-GAs should be considered a new grand challenge of computer science research.},

A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks—their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits—but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.},

We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +14.6\% average accuracy on XNLI, +13\% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.4\% F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7\% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4\% for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing per-language performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make our code, data and models publicly available.},

  abstract = {Defining structure and detecting the emergence of complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties, these problems can be analyzed in terms of how model-building observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in nonlinear processes. An observer's notion of what is ordered, what is random, and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and inference. The discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtlely though on how those resources are organized. The descriptive power of the observer's chosen (or implicit) computational model class, for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data. This paper presents an overview of an inductive framework-hierarchical ϵ-machine reconstruction—in which the emergence of complexity is associated with the innovation of new computational model classes. Complexity metrics for detecting structure and quantifying emergence, along with an analysis of the constraints on the dynamics of innovation, are outlined. Illustrative examples are drawn from the onset of unpredictability in nonlinear systems, finitary nondeterministic processes, and cellular automata pattern recognition. They demonstrate how finite inference resources drive the innovation of new structures and so lead to the emergence of complexity.},

We investigate this phenomenon using minimal computational models of dynamical systems that undergo a transition to chaos as a function of a nonlinearity parameter. For period-doubling and band-merging cascades, we derive expressions for the entropy, the interdependence of-machine complexity and entropy, and the latent complexity of the transition to chaos. At the transition deterministic finite automaton models diverge in size. Although there is no regular or context-free Chomsky grammar in this case, we give finite descriptions at the higher computational level of context-free Lindenmayer systems. We construct a restricted indexed context-free grammar and its associated one-way nondeterministic nested stack automaton for the cascade limit language. This analysis of a family of dynamical systems suggests a complexity theoretic description of phase transitions based on the informational diversity and computational complexity of observed data that is independent of particular system control parameters. The approach gives a much more refined picture of the architecture of critical states than is available via},

The resulting filtered patterns uncover significant structural organization in a CA’s dynamics and information processing capabilities. We illustrate the decomposition technique by analyzing a binary, range-2 cellular automaton having two invariant chaotic domains of different complexities and entropies. Once identified, the domains are seen to organize the CA’s state space and to dominate its evolution. Starting from the domains’ structures, we show how to construct a finite-state transducer that performs nonlinear spatial filtering such that the resulting space-time patterns reveal the domains and the intervening walls and dislocations. To show the statistical consequences of domain detection, we compare the entropy and complexity densities of each domain with the globally averaged quantities. A more graphical comparison uses difference patterns and difference plumes which trace the space-time influence of a single-site perturbation. We also investigate the diversity of walls and particles emanating from the interface between two adjacent domains.},

  abstract = {Variational problems that involve Wasserstein distances and more generally optimal transport (OT) theory are playing an increasingly important role in data sciences. Such problems can be used to form an examplar measure out of various probability measures, as in the Wasserstein barycenter problem, or to carry out parametric inference and density fitting, where the loss is measured in terms of an optimal transport cost to the measure of observations. Despite being conceptually simple, such problems are computationally challenging because they involve minimizing over quantities (Wasserstein distances) that are themselves hard to compute. Entropic regularization has recently emerged as an efficient tool to approximate the solution of such variational Wasserstein problems. In this paper, we give a thorough duality tour of these regularization techniques. In particular, we show how important concepts from classical OT such as c-transforms and semi-discrete approaches translate into similar ideas in a regularized setting. These dual formulations lead to smooth variational problems, which can be solved using smooth, differentiable and convex optimization problems that are simpler to implement and numerically more stable that their un-regularized counterparts. We illustrate the versatility of this approach by applying it to the computation of Wasserstein barycenters and gradient flows of spatial regularization functionals.},

Despite their appealing theoretical properties, excellent performance in retrieval tasks and intuitive formulation, their computation involves the resolution of a linear program whose cost can quickly become prohibitive whenever the size of the support of these measures or the histograms’ dimension exceeds a few hundred. We propose in this work a new family of optimal transport distances that look at transport problems from a maximumentropy perspective. We smooth the classic optimal transport problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn’s matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transport solvers. We also show that this regularized distance improves upon classic optimal transport distances on the MNIST classification problem.},

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80\% longer than RNNs and 450\% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens.

We analyze the emergent logic underlying these strategies in terms of information processing performed by “particles” in space-time, and we describe in detail the generational progression of the GA evolution of these strategies. Our analysis is a preliminary step in understanding the general mechanisms by which sophisticated emergent computational capabilities can be automatically produced in decentralized multiprocessor systems.},

  abstract = {Although knowledge representation is one of the central and in some ways most familiar concepts in AI, the most fundamental question about it - What is it? - has rarely been answered directly. Numerous papers have lobbied for one or another variety of representation, other papers have argued for various prop erties a representation should have while still others have fo cused on prop erties that are imp ortant to the notion of representation in general In this paper we go back to basics to address the question directly. We believe that the answer can best be understood in terms of five important and distinctly different roles that a representation plays, each of which places different and at times conflicting demands on the properties a representation should have. We argue that keeping in mind all five of these roles provides a usefully broad perspective that sheds light on some longstanding disputes and can invigorate both research and practice in the field.},

  abstract = {The concept of emergence is used in a variety of scientific fields and disciplines to denote an even wider variety of phenomena. This has resulted in a plethora of perspectives and treatments. The diversity of phenomena going under the moniker of emergence raises the question of what these phenomena have in common and whether different types of emergence can be distinguished on general grounds. Since emergence is recognised in so many different fields as a relevant concept, it would be useful to have a general conceptual framework that allows a treatment of emergence without explicit reference to the specific underlying mechanism. This article aims to provide a general framework in which emergence can be addressed. For this a new concept, the conjugate, is introduced and the place of the observer relative to the system is given a renewed appreciation. Since the framework abstracts from the underlying interactions, emergence in different types of systems can be compared and discussed on equal terms. Reframing emergence in this way leads to a typology of emergences that is both illuminating and integrative In the elaboration the concepts and different types of emergence are discussed and compared with other treatments and typologies of emergence in the literature. Examples from various fields are given to illustrate the theoretical discourse. Furthermore applications of the concepts and typology to social systems, evolution, and co-evolution in ecosystems will be given It will be concluded that many apparently different views and treatments of emergence can be restated and compared within the framework presented in this article.},

The resulting network resembles a static entity of knowledge, with endeavours to extend this knowledge without targeting the original task resulting in a catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning shifts this paradigm towards networks that can continually accumulate knowledge over different tasks without the need to retrain from scratch. We focus on task incremental classification, where tasks arrive sequentially and are delineated by clear boundaries. Our main contributions concern 1) a taxonomy and extensive overview of the state-of-the-art, 2) a novel framework to continually determine the stability-plasticity trade-off of the continual learner, 3) a comprehensive experimental comparison of 11 state-of-the-art continual learning methods and 4 baselines. We empirically scrutinize method strengths and weaknesses on three benchmarks, considering Tiny Imagenet and large-scale unbalanced iNaturalist and a sequence of recognition datasets. We study the influence of model capacity, weight decay and dropout regularization, and the order in which the tasks are presented, and qualitatively compare methods in terms of required memory, computation time, and storage.},

Current algorithms in anomaly detection are based on the classical density estimation approach of learning high-dimensional models and finding low-probability events. These algorithms are sensitive to the order in which anomalies appear and require either training data or early context assumptions that do not hold for longer, more complex videos. By defining anomalies as examples that can be distinguished from other examples in the same video, our definition inspires a shift in approaches from classical density estimation to simple discriminative learning. Our contributions include a novel framework for anomaly detection that is (1) independent of temporal ordering of anomalies, and (2) unsupervised, requiring no separate training sequences. We show that our algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art results even when we adjust the setting by removing training sequences from standard datasets.},

In this work, we describe DeepDive, a system that combines database and machine learning ideas to help develop KBC systems, and we present techniques to make the KBC process more efficient. We observe that the KBC process is iterative, and we develop techniques to incrementally produce inference results for KBC systems. We propose two methods for incremental inference, based respectively on sampling and variational techniques. We also study the tradeoff space of these methods and develop a simple rule-based optimizer. DeepDive includes all of these contributions, and we evaluate DeepDive on five KBC systems, showing that it can speed up KBC inference tasks by up to two orders of magnitude with negligible impact on quality.},

  abstract = {Large language models have been widely adopted but require significant GPU memory for inference. We develop a procedure for Int8 matrix multiplication for feed-forward and attention projection layers in transformers, which cut the memory needed for inference by half while retaining full precision performance. With our method, a 175B parameter 16/32-bit checkpoint can be loaded, converted to Int8, and used immediately without performance degradation. This is made possible by understanding and working around properties of highly systematic emergent features in transformer language models that dominate attention and transformer predictive performance. To cope with these features, we develop a two-part quantization procedure, LLM.int8(). We first use vector-wise quantization with separate normalization constants for each inner product in the matrix multiplication, to quantize most of the features. However, for the emergent outliers, we also include a new mixed-precision decomposition scheme, which isolates the outlier feature dimensions into a 16-bit matrix multiplication while still more than 99.9\% of values are multiplied in 8-bit. Using LLM.int8(), we show empirically it is possible to perform inference in LLMs with up to 175B parameters without any performance degradation. This result makes such models much more accessible, for example making it possible to use OPT-175B/BLOOM on a single server with consumer GPUs.},

A second subnetwork, corresponding to the striatum, associates these state-encoding patterns with the correct response at each point in the sequence execution. From a neuroscience perspective, the model is based on the known cortical and subcortical anatomy of the primate oculomotor system. From a theoretical perspective, the architecture is similar to that of a finite automaton in which outputs and state transitions are generated as a function of inputs and the current state. Simulation results for complex sequence reproduction and sequence discrimination are presented.},

(2) Cortex influences the saccade system in part via corticostriatal projections. (3) A reinforcement learning mechanism modifies corticostriatal synapses to link patterns of cortical activity to the correct saccade responses during trial-and-error learning. Our conditional visual discrimination model learns to associate visual cues with the corresponding saccades to one of two left-right targets. A visual cue produces patterns of neuronal activity in inferotemporal cortex (IT) that projects to the oculomotor region of the striatum. Initially random saccadic "guesses," when directed to the correct target for the current cue, result in increased synaptic strength between the cue-related IT cells and the striatal cells that participate in the correct saccade, increasing the probability that this cue will later elicit the correct saccade. We show that the model generates "inhibitory gradients" on the striatum as the substrate for spatial generalization. Our sequence reproduction model learns, when presented with temporal sequences of spatial targets, to reproduce the corresponding sequence of saccades. At any point in the execution of a saccade sequence, the current pattern of activity in pre-frontal cortex (PFC), combined with visual input and the motor efferent copy of the previous saccade, produces a new pattern of activity in PFC to be associated with the next saccade. Like IT, PFC also projects to the oculomotor region of the striatum. Correct guesses for the subsequent saccade in the sequence results in strengthening of corticostriatal synapses between active PFC cells and striatal cells involved in the correct saccade. The sequence is thus reproduced as a concatenation of associations. We compare the results of this model with data previously obtained in the monkey and discuss the nature of cortical representations of spatiotemporal information.},

So far this interface layer has been missing in AI. First-order logic and probabilistic graphical models each have some of the necessary features, but a viable interface layer requires combining both. Markov logic is a powerful new language that accomplishes this by attaching weights to first-order formulas and treating them as templates for features of Markov random fields. Most statistical models in wide use are special cases of Markov logic, and first-order logic is its infinite-weight limit. Inference algorithms for Markov logic combine ideas from satisfiability, Markov chain Monte Carlo, belief propagation, and resolution. Learning algorithms make use of conditional likelihood, convex optimization, and inductive logic programming. Markov logic has been successfully applied to problems in information extraction and integration, natural language processing, robot mapping, social networks, computational biology, and others, and is the basis of the open-source Alchemy system.},

  abstract = {Echo state networks (ESNs) are gaining popularity as a method for recognizing patterns in time series data. ESNs are random, recurrent neural network topologies that are able to integrate temporal data over short time windows by operating on the edge of chaos. In this paper, we explore the design of a hardware ESN with bi-stable memristor-based synapses. Hybrid CMOS/memristor hardware implementations of ESNs are able to exploit non-linear device physics, improving power consumption, and boosting performance over software approaches. However, the digital nature of most experimental memristors places a limit on the precision of weight states in the ESN's readout layer. In spite of this, we show that ESNs with only 5 different readout layer weight states can acheive 67\% accuracy in spoken digit recognition tasks.},

  abstract = {Novelty Search is an exploration algorithm driven by the novelty of a behavior. The same individual evaluated at different generations has different fitness values. The corresponding fitness landscape is thus constantly changing and if, at the scale of a single generation, the metaphor of a fitness landscape with peaks and valleys still holds, this is not the case anymore at the scale of the whole evolutionary process. How does this kind of algorithms behave? Is it possible to define a model that would help understand how it works? This understanding is critical to analyse existing Novelty Search variants and design new and potentially more efficient ones. We assert that Novelty Search asymptotically behaves like a uniform random search process in the behavior space. This is an interesting feature, as it is not possible to directly sample in this space: the algorithm has a direct access to the genotype space only, whose relationship to the behavior space is complex. We describe the model and check its consistency on a classical Novelty Search experiment. We also show that it sheds a new light on results of the literature and suggests future research work.},

  abstract = {The task of data fusion is to identify the true values of data items (eg, the true date of birth for Tom Cruise) among multiple observed values drawn from different sources (eg, Web sites) of varying (and unknown) reliability. A recent survey LDL+12 has provided a detailed comparison of various fusion methods on Deep Web data. In this paper, we study the applicability and limitations of different fusion techniques on a more challenging problem: knowledge fusion. Knowledge fusion identifies true subject-predicate-object triples extracted by multiple information extractors from multiple information sources. These extractors perform the tasks of entity linkage and schema alignment, thus introducing an additional source of noise that is quite different from that traditionally considered in the data fusion literature, which only focuses on factual errors in the original sources. We adapt state-of-the-art data fusion techniques and apply them to a knowledge base with 1.6B unique knowledge triples extracted by 12 extractors from over 1B Web pages, which is three orders of magnitude larger than the data sets used in previous data fusion papers. We show great promise of the data fusion approaches in solving the knowledge fusion problem, and suggest interesting research directions through a detailed error analysis of the methods.},

  abstract = {Many data management applications, such as setting up Web por- tals, managing enterprise data, managing community data, and shar- ing scientific data, require integrating data from multiple sources. Each of these sources provides a set of values and different sources can often provide conflicting values. To present quality data to users, it is critical that data integration systems can resolve con- flicts and discover true values. Typically, we expect a true value to be provided by more sources than any particular false one, so we can take the value provided by the majority of the sources as the truth. Unfortunately, a false value can be spread through copying and that makes truth discovery extremely tricky. In this paper, we consider how to find true values from conflicting information when there are a large number of sources, among which some may copy from others. We present a novel approach that considers dependence between data sources in truth discovery. Intuitively, if two data sources pro- vide a large number of common values and many of these values are rarely provided by other sources (e.g., particular false values), it is very likely that one copies from the other. We apply Bayesian analysis to decide dependence between sources and design an algo- rithm that iteratively detects dependence and discovers truth from conflicting information. We also extend our model by consider- ing accuracy of data sources and similarity between values. Our experiments on synthetic data as well as real-world data show that our algorithm can significantly improve accuracy of truth discovery and is scalable when there are a large number of data sources.},

The two proposed methods, Recurrent Kernel and Structured Reservoir Computing, turn out to be much faster and more memory-efficient than conventional Reservoir Computing.},

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has been successful in learning sophisticated behaviors automatically; however, the learning process requires a huge number of trials. In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few trials, benefiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a "fast" reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network (RNN) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, RL\$\^2\$, the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the RNN, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose ("slow") RL algorithm. The RNN receives all information a typical RL algorithm would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination flags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process (MDP). The activations of the RNN store the state of the "fast" RL algorithm on the current (previously unseen) MDP. We evaluate RL\$\^2\$ experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite MDPs. After RL\$\^2\$ is trained, its performance on new MDPs is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test RL\$\^2\$ on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to high-dimensional problems.},

For example, thanks to scaling, GPT-3 was able to achieve strong results on in-context learning tasks. However, training these large dense models requires significant amounts of computing resources. In this paper, we propose and develop a family of language models named GLaM (Generalist Language Model), which uses a sparsely activated mixture-of-experts architecture to scale the model capacity while also incurring substantially less training cost compared to dense variants. The largest GLaM has 1.2 trillion parameters, which is approximately 7x larger than GPT-3. It consumes only 1/3 of the energy used to train GPT-3 and requires half of the computation flops for inference, while still achieving better overall zero-shot and one-shot performance across 29 NLP tasks.},

However, none of the pretraining frameworks performs the best for all tasks of three main categories including natural language understanding (NLU), unconditional generation, and conditional generation. We propose a General Language Model (GLM) based on autoregressive blank infilling to address this challenge. GLM improves blank filling pretraining by adding 2D positional encodings and allowing an arbitrary order to predict spans, which results in performance gains over BERT and T5 on NLU tasks. Meanwhile, GLM can be pretrained for different types of tasks by varying the number and lengths of blanks. On a wide range of tasks across NLU, conditional and unconditional generation, GLM outperforms BERT, T5, and GPT given the same model sizes and data, and achieves the best performance from a single pretrained model with 1.25x parameters of BERT Large , demonstrating its generalizability to different downstream tasks.},

A large variety of interpretations has hampered the evolution of a common understanding of knowledge graphs. Numerous research papers refer to Google’s Knowledge Graph, although no official documentation about the used methods exists. The prerequisite for widespread academic and commercial adoption of a concept or technology is a common understanding, based ideally on a definition that is free from ambiguity. We tackle this issue by discussing and defining the term knowledge graph, considering its history and diversity in interpretations and use.

  abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves: the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands: indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

  abstract = {As the size of modern datasets exceeds the disk and memory capacities of a single com-puter, machine learning practitioners have resorted to parallel and distributed comput-ing. Given that optimization is one of the pillars of machine learning and predictive modeling, distributed optimization methods have recently garnered ample attention, in particular when either observations or features are distributed, but not both. We propose a general stochastic algorithm where observations, features, and gradient com-ponents can be sampled in a double distributed setting, i.e., with both features and observations distributed. Very technical analyses establish convergence properties of the algorithm under different conditions on the learning rate (diminishing to zero or constant). Computational experiments in Spark demonstrate a superior performance of our algorithm versus a benchmark in early iterations of the algorithm, which is due to the stochastic components of the algorithm.},

Experiments show large improvements over strong baselines on both automated and human evaluations. Human judges prefer stories generated by our approach to those from a strong non-hierarchical model by a factor of two to one.},

The finite-state predictability of an infinite sequence is defined as the minimum fraction of prediction errors that can be made by any finite-state (FS) predictor. It is proven that this FS predictability can be achieved by universal sequential prediction schemes. An efficient prediction procedure based on the incremental parsing procedure of the Lempel-Ziv data compression algorithm is shown to achieve asymptotically the FS predictability. Some relations between compressibility and predictability are discussed, and the predictability is proposed as an additional measure of the complexity of a sequence.{$<>$}},

However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.},

Recently, Lòpez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209 (1995) 321] introduced another measure of statistical complexity CLMC that, like others, satisfies the “boundary conditions” of vanishing in the extreme ordered and disordered limits. We examine some properties of CLMC and find that it is neither an intensive nor an extensive thermodynamic variable and that it vanishes exponentially in the thermodynamic limit for all one-dimensional finite-range spin systems. We propose a simple alteration of CLMC that renders it extensive. However, this remedy results in a quantity that is a trivial function of the entropy density and hence of no use as a measure of structure or memory. We conclude by suggesting that a useful “statistical complexity” must not only obey the ordered-random boundary conditions of vanishing, it must also be defined in a setting that gives a clear interpretation to what structures are quantified.},

In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two fewshot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.},

  abstract = {Quality-Diversity optimisation algorithms enable the evolution of collections of both high-performing and diverse solutions. These collections offer the possibility to quickly adapt and switch from one solution to another in case it is not working as expected. It therefore finds many applications in real-world domain problems such as robotic control. However, QD algorithms, like most optimisation algorithms, are very sensitive to uncertainty on the fitness function, but also on the behavioural descriptors. Yet, such uncertainties are frequent in real-world applications. Few works have explored this issue in the specific case of QD algorithms, and inspired by the literature in Evolutionary Computation, mainly focus on using sampling to approximate the ”true” value of the performances of a solution. However, sampling approaches require a high number of evaluations, which in many applications such as robotics, can quickly become impractical. In this work, we propose Deep-Grid MAP-Elites, a variant of the MAP-Elites algorithm that uses an archive of similar previously encountered solutions to approximate the performance of a solution. We compare our approach to previously explored ones on three noisy tasks: a standard optimisation task, the control of a redundant arm and a simulated Hexapod robot. The experimental results show that this simple approach is significantly more resilient to noise on the behavioural descriptors, while achieving competitive performances in terms of fitness optimisation, and being more sample-efficient than other existing approaches.},

Several competing hypotheses for the evolutionary mechanisms that shape metabolic networks have been discussed in the literature, each of which finds support from comparative analysis of extant genomes. Alternatively, the principles of metabolic evolution can be studied by direct computer simulation. This requires, however, an explicit implementation of all pertinent components: a universe of chemical reactions upon which the metabolism is built, an explicit representation of the enzymes that implement the metabolism, a genetic system that encodes these enzymes, and a fitness function that can be selected for.                                         Results                                We describe here a simulation environment that implements all these components in a simplified way so that large-scale evolutionary studies are feasible. We employ an artificial chemistry that views chemical reactions as graph rewriting operations and utilizes a toy-version of quantum chemistry to derive thermodynamic parameters. Minimalist organisms with simple string-encoded genomes produce model ribozymes whose catalytic activity is determined by an                 ad hoc                 mapping between their secondary structure and the transition state graphs that they stabilize. Fitness is computed utilizing the ideas of metabolic flux analysis. We present an implementation of the complete system and first simulation results.

  abstract = {Meta-learning empowers artificial intelligence to increase its efficiency by learning how to learn. Unlocking this potential involves overcoming a challenging meta-optimisation problem that often exhibits ill-conditioning, and myopic metaobjectives. We propose an algorithm that tackles these issues by letting the metalearner teach itself. The algorithm first bootstraps a target from the meta-learner, then optimises the meta-learner by minimising the distance to that target under a chosen (pseudo-)metric. Focusing on meta-learning with gradients, we establish conditions that guarantee performance improvements and show that the improvement is related to the target distance. Thus, by controlling curvature, the distance measure can be used to ease meta-optimization, for instance by reducing ill-conditioning. Further, the bootstrapping mechanism can extend the effective meta-learning horizon without requiring backpropagation through all updates. The algorithm is versatile and easy to implement. We achieve a new state-of-the art for model-free agents on the Atari ALE benchmark, improve upon MAML in few-shot learning, and demonstrate how our approach opens up new possibilities by meta-learning efficient exploration in an ε-greedy Q-learning agent.},

However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance. We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the "lottery ticket hypothesis:" dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks ("winning tickets") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20\% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.},

  abstract = {Meta-learning models, or models that learn to learn, have been a long-desired target for their ability to quickly solve new tasks. Traditional meta-learning methods can require expensive inner and outer loops, thus there is demand for algorithms that discover strong learners without explicitly searching for them. We draw parallels to the study of evolvable genomes in evolutionary systems -- genomes with a strong capacity to adapt -- and propose that meta-learning and adaptive evolvability optimize for the same objective: high performance after a set of learning iterations. We argue that population-based evolutionary systems with non-static fitness landscapes naturally bias towards high-evolvability genomes, and therefore optimize for populations with strong learning ability. We demonstrate this claim with a simple evolutionary algorithm, Population-Based Meta Learning (PBML), that consistently discovers genomes which display higher rates of improvement over generations, and can rapidly adapt to solve sparse fitness and robotic control tasks.},

  abstract = {All natural cognitive systems, and, in particular, our own, gradually forget previously learned information. Plausible models of human cognition should therefore exhibit similar patterns of gradual forgetting of old information as new information is acquired. Only rarely does new learning in natural cognitive systems completely disrupt or erase previously learned information; that is, natural cognitive systems do not, in general, forget ‘catastrophically’. Unfortunately, though, catastrophic forgetting does occur under certain circumstances in distributed connectionist networks. The very features that give these networks their remarkable abilities to generalize, to function in the presence of degraded input, and so on, are found to be the root cause of catastrophic forgetting. The challenge in this field is to discover how to keep the advantages of distributed connectionist networks while avoiding the problem of catastrophic forgetting. In this article the causes, consequences and numerous solutions to the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks are examined. The review will consider how the brain might have overcome this problem and will also explore the consequences of this solution for distributed connectionist networks.},

In this paper we develop a loss function for multi-label learning, based on the Wasserstein distance. The Wasserstein distance provides a natural notion of dissimilarity for probability measures. Although optimizing with respect to the exact Wasserstein distance is costly, recent work has described a regularized approximation that is efficiently computed. We describe an efficient learning algorithm based on this regularization, as well as a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance from probability measures to unnormalized measures. We also describe a statistical learning bound for the loss. The Wasserstein loss can encourage smoothness of the predictions with respect to a chosen metric on the output space. We demonstrate this property on a real-data tag prediction problem, using the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons dataset, outperforming a baseline that doesn’t use the metric.},

The effectiveness of the encoding scheme is demonstrated in an object recognition task that requires artificial creatures (whose behaviour is driven by a neural network) to develop high-level finite-state exploration and discrimination strategies. The task requires solving the sensory-motor grounding problem, i.e. developing a functional understanding of the effects that a creature 's movement has on its sensory input.  1 Introduction  The behaviour of a particular biological organism is driven by its neural circuitry.

  abstract = {In a probabilistic cellular automaton in which all local transitions have positive probability, the problem of keeping a bit of information indefinitely is nontrivial, even in an infinite automaton. Still, there is a solution in 2 dimensions, and this solution can be used to construct a simple 3-dimensional discrete-time universal fault-tolerant cellular automaton. This technique does not help much to solve the following problems: remembering a bit of information in 1 dimension; computing in dimensions lower than 3; computing in any dimension with non-synchronized transitions. Our more complex technique organizes the cells in blocks that perform a reliable simulation of a second (generalized) cellular automaton. The cells of the latter automaton are also organized in blocks, simulating even more reliably a third automaton, etc. Since all this (a possibly infinite hierarchy) is organized in “software,” it must be under repair all the time from damage caused by errors. A large part of the problem is essentially self-stabilization recovering from a mess of arbitrary size and content. The present paper constructs an asynchronous one-dimensional fault-tolerant cellular automaton, with the further feature of “self-organization.” The latter means that unless a large amount of input information must be given, the initial configuration can be chosen homogeneous.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in information extraction have led to huge knowledge bases (KBs), which capture knowledge in a machine-readable format. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) can be used to mine logical rules from the KB. These rules can help deduce and add missing knowledge to the KB. While ILP is a mature field, mining logical rules from KBs is different in two aspects: First, current rule mining systems are easily overwhelmed by the amount of data (state-of-the art systems cannot even run on today’s KBs). Second, ILP usually requires counterexamples. KBs, however, implement the open world assumption (OWA), meaning that absent data cannot be used as counterexamples. In this paper, we develop a rule mining model that is explicitly tailored to support the OWA scenario. It is inspired by association rule mining and introduces a novel measure for confidence. Our extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision and coverage. Furthermore, our system, AMIE, mines rules orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art approaches.},

Besides, theoretical studies in RC area can contribute to the broader field of Recurrent Neural Networks research by enabling a deeper understanding of the fundamental capabilities of dynamical recurrent models, even in the absence of training of the recurrent connections.

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, DeepWordBug, to effectively generate small text perturbations in a black-box setting that forces a deep-learning classifier to misclassify a text input. We employ novel scoring strategies to identify the critical tokens that, if modified, cause the classifier to make an incorrect prediction. Simple character-level transformations are applied to the highest-ranked tokens in order to minimize the edit distance of the perturbation, yet change the original classification. We evaluated DeepWordBug on eight real-world text datasets, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and spam detection. We compare the result of DeepWordBug with two baselines: Random (Black-box) and Gradient (White-box). Our experimental results indicate that DeepWordBug reduces the prediction accuracy of current state-of-the-art deep-learning models, including a decrease of 68\textbackslash\% on average for a Word-LSTM model and 48\textbackslash\% on average for a Char-CNN model.},

These strategies can lead to out-of-context and unnaturally complex token replacements, which are easily identifiable by humans. We present BAE, a black box attack for generating adversarial examples using contextual perturbations from a BERT masked language model. BAE replaces and inserts tokens in the original text by masking a portion of the text and leveraging the BERT-MLM to generate alternatives for the masked tokens. Through automatic and human evaluations, we show that BAE performs a stronger attack, in addition to generating adversarial examples with improved grammaticality and semantic coherence as compared to prior work.},

On the other hand, adaptive complex systems, life in particular, exhibit a sense of permanence and time lessness amidst relentless constant changes in surrounding environments that make the global properties of the physical world the most important problems in understanding their nature and structure. Thus, much of the differential and integral Calculus deals with the problem of passing from local information (as expressed, for example, by a differential equation, or the contour of a region) to global features of a system's behavior (an equation of growth, or an area). Fundamental laws in the exact sciences seek to express the observable global behavior of physical objects through equations about local interaction of their components, on the assumption that the continuum is the most accurate model of physical reality. Paradoxically, much of modern physics calls for a fundamen tal discrete component in our understanding of the physical world. Useful computational models must be eventually constructed in hardware, and as such can only be based on local interaction of simple processing elements.},

We introduce A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style that can separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images.

Recent results demonstrate the equivalence of reservoir computing to nonlinear vector autoregression, which requires no random matrices, fewer metaparameters, and provides interpretable results.

This assumption renders these theories inadequate for characterizing 21\$\^\{st\}\$ century real world data problems, which are typically characterized by evaluation distributions that differ from the training data distributions (referred to as out-of-distribution learning). We therefore make a small change to existing formal definitions of learnability by relaxing that assumption. We then introduce \$\textbackslash mathbf\{learning\textbackslash{} efficiency\}\$ (LE) to quantify the amount a learner is able to leverage data for a given problem, regardless of whether it is an in- or out-of-distribution problem. We then define and prove the relationship between generalized notions of learnability, and show how this framework is sufficiently general to characterize transfer, multitask, meta, continual, and lifelong learning. We hope this unification helps bridge the gap between empirical practice and theoretical guidance in real world problems. Finally, because biological learning continues to outperform machine learning algorithms on certain OOD challenges, we discuss the limitations of this framework vis-\textbackslash 'a-vis its ability to formalize biological learning, suggesting multiple avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {From one of the architects of the new science of simplicity and complexity comes a highly personal, unifying vision of the natural world. As a theoretical physicist, Murray Gell-Mann has explored nature at its most fundamental level. His achievements include the 1969 Nobel Prize for work leading up to his discovery of the quark - the basic building block of all atomic nuclei throughout the universe. But Gell-Mann is a man of many intellectual passions, with lifelong interests in fields that seek to understand existence at its most complex: natural history, biological evolution, the history of language, and the study of creative thinking. These seemingly disparate pursuits come together in Gell-Mann's current work at the Santa Fe Institute, where scientists are investigating the similarities and differences among complex adaptive systems - systems that learn or evolve by utilizing acquired information. They include a child learning his or her native language, a strain of bacteria becoming resistant to an antibiotic, the scientific community testing new theories, or an artist implementing a creative idea. The Quark and the Jaguar is Gell-Mann's own story of finding the connections between the basic laws of physics and the complexity and diversity of the natural world. The simple: a quark inside an atom. The complex: a jaguar prowling its jungle territory in the night. Exploring the relationship between them becomes a series of exciting intellectual adventures.},

  abstract = {We present a biologically inspired architecture for incremental learning that remains resource-efficient even in the face of very high data dimensionalities ({$>$}1000) that are typically associated with perceptual problems. In particular, we investigate how a new perceptual (object) class can be added to a trained architecture without retraining, while avoiding the well-known catastrophic forgetting effects typically associated with such scenarios. At the heart of the presented architecture lies a generative description of the perceptual space by a self-organized approach which at the same time approximates the neighborhood relations in this space on a two-dimensional plane. This approximation, which closely imitates the topographic organization of the visual cortex, allows an efficient local update rule for incremental learning even in the face of very high dimensionalities, which we demonstrate by tests on the well-known MNIST benchmark. We complement the model by adding a biologically plausible short-term memory system, allowing it to retain excellent classification accuracy even under incremental learning in progress. The short-term memory is additionally used to reinforce new data statistics by replaying previously stored samples during dedicated “sleep” phases.},

  abstract = {Self-organization can be broadly defined as the ability of a system to display ordered spatiotemporal patterns solely as the result of the interactions among the system components. Processes of this kind characterize both living and artificial systems, making self-organization a concept that is at the basis of several disciplines, from physics to biology and engineering. Placed at the frontiers between disciplines, artificial life (ALife) has heavily borrowed concepts and tools from the study of self-organization, providing mechanistic interpretations of lifelike phenomena as well as useful constructivist approaches to artificial system design. Despite its broad usage within ALife, the concept of self-organization has been often excessively stretched or misinterpreted, calling for a clarification that could help with tracing the borders between what can and cannot be considered self-organization. In this review, we discuss the fundamental aspects of self-organization and list the main usages within three primary ALife domains, namely “soft” (mathematical/computational modeling), “hard” (physical robots), and “wet” (chemical/biological systems) ALife. We also provide a classification to locate this research. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of self-organization and related concepts within ALife studies, point to perspectives and challenges for future research, and list open questions. We hope that this work will motivate discussions related to self-organization in ALife and related fields.},

  abstract = {Deep learning techniques have recently demonstrated broad success in predicting complex dynamical systems ranging from turbulence to human speech, motivating broader questions about how neural networks encode and represent dynamical rules. We explore this problem in the context of cellular automata (CA), simple dynamical systems that are intrinsically discrete and thus difficult to analyze using standard tools from dynamical systems theory. We show that any CA may readily be represented using a convolutional neural network with a network-in-network architecture. This motivates our development of a general convolutional multilayer perceptron architecture, which we find can learn the dynamical rules for arbitrary CA when given videos of the CA as training data. In the limit of large network widths, we find that training dynamics are strongly stereotyped across replicates, and that common patterns emerge in the structure of networks trained on different CA rulesets. We train ensembles of networks on randomly-sampled CA, and we probe how the trained networks internally represent the CA rules using an information-theoretic technique based on distributions of layer activation patterns. We find that CA with simpler rule tables produce trained networks with hierarchical structure and layer specialization, while more complex CA tend to produce shallower representations---illustrating how the underlying complexity of the CA's rules influences the specificity of these internal representations. Our results suggest how the entropy of a physical process can affect its representation when learned by neural networks.},

We use reinforcement learning from human feedback to train our models with two new additions to help human raters judge agent behaviour. First, to make our agent more helpful and harmless, we break down the requirements for good dialogue into natural language rules the agent should follow, and ask raters about each rule separately. We demonstrate that this breakdown enables us to collect more targeted human judgements of agent behaviour and allows for more efficient rule-conditional reward models. Second, our agent provides evidence from sources supporting factual claims when collecting preference judgements over model statements. For factual questions, evidence provided by Sparrow supports the sampled response 78\% of the time. Sparrow is preferred more often than baselines while being more resilient to adversarial probing by humans, violating our rules only 8\% of the time when probed. Finally, we conduct extensive analyses showing that though our model learns to follow our rules it can exhibit distributional biases.},

  abstract = {Though word-of-mouth (w-o-m) communications is a pervasive and intriguing phenomenon, little is known on its underlying process of personal communications. Moreover as marketers are getting more interested in harnessing the power of w-o-m, for e-business and other net related activities, the effects of the different communications types on macro level marketing is becoming critical. In particular we are interested in the breakdown of the personal communication between closer and stronger communications that are within an individual's own personal group (strong ties) and weaker and less personal communications that an individual makes with a wide set of other acquaintances and colleagues (weak ties).We use a technique borrowed from Complex Systems Analysis called stochastic cellular automata in order to generate data and analyze the results so that answers to our main research issues could be ascertained. The following summarizes the impact of strong and weak ties on the speed of acceptance of a new product:••The influence of weak ties is at least as strong as the influence of strong ties. Despite the relative inferiority of the weak tie parameter in the model's assumptions, their effect approximates or exceeds that of strong ties, in all stages of the product life cycle.••External marketing efforts (e.g., advertising) are effective. However, beyond a relatively early stage of the growth cycle of the new product, their efficacy quickly diminishes and strong and weak ties become the main forces propelling growth. The results clearly indicate that information dissemination is dominated by both weak and strong w-o-m, rather than by advertising.••The effect of strong ties diminishes as personal network size decreases. Market attributes were also found to mediate the effects of weak and strong ties. When personal networks are small, weak ties were found to have a stronger impact on information dissemination than strong ties.},

  abstract = {We study the flow of information and the evolution of internal representations during deep neural network (DNN) training, aiming to demystify the compression aspect of the information bottleneck theory. The theory suggests that DNN training comprises a rapid fitting phase followed by a slower compression phase, in which the mutual information I(X; T ) between the input X and internal representations T decreases. Several papers observe compression of estimated mutual information on different DNN models, but the true I(X; T ) over these networks is provably either constant (discrete X) or infinite (continuous X). This work explains the discrepancy between theory and experiments, and clarifies what was actually measured by these past works. To this end, we introduce an auxiliary (noisy) DNN framework for which I(X; T ) is a meaningful quantity that depends on the network’s parameters. This noisy framework is shown to be a good proxy for the original (deterministic) DNN both in terms of performance and the learned representations. We then develop a rigorous estimator for I(X; T ) in noisy DNNs and observe compression in various models. By relating I(X; T ) in the noisy DNN to an information-theoretic communication problem, we show that compression is driven by the progressive clustering of hidden representations of inputs from the same class. Several methods to directly monitor clustering of hidden representations, both in noisy and deterministic DNNs, are used to show that meaningful clusters form in the T space. Finally, we return to the estimator of I(X; T ) employed in past works, and demonstrate that while it fails to capture the true (vacuous) mutual information, it does serve as a measure for clustering. This clarifies the past observations of compression and isolates the geometric clustering of hidden representations as the true phenomenon of interest.},

Along with a large number of successful applications, many different variants of novelty search have been proposed. It is still unclear, however, how some key parameters and algorithmic components influence the evolutionary dynamics and performance of novelty search. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study focused on novelty search's algorithmic components. We study the "k" parameter -- the number of nearest neighbours used in the computation of novelty scores; the use and function of an archive; how to combine novelty search with fitness-based evolution; and how to configure the mutation rate of the underlying evolutionary algorithm. Our study is conducted in a simulated maze navigation task. Our results show that the configuration of novelty search can have a significant impact on performance and behaviour space exploration. We conclude with a number of guidelines for the implementation and configuration of novelty search, which should help future practitioners to apply novelty search more effectively.},

  abstract = {Novelty search is a recent artificial evolution technique that challenges traditional evolutionary approaches. In novelty search, solutions are rewarded based on their novelty, rather than their quality with respect to a predefined objective. The lack of a predefined objective precludes premature convergence caused by a deceptive fitness function. In this paper, we apply novelty search combined with NEAT to the evolution of neural controllers for homogeneous swarms of robots. Our empirical study is conducted in simulation, and we use a common swarm robotics task—aggregation, and a more challenging task—sharing of an energy recharging station. Our results show that novelty search is unaffected by deception, is notably effective in bootstrapping evolution, can find solutions with lower complexity than fitness-based evolution, and can find a broad diversity of solutions for the same task. Even in non-deceptive setups, novelty search achieves solution qualities similar to those obtained in traditional fitness-based evolution. Our study also encompasses variants of novelty search that work in concert with fitness-based evolution to combine the exploratory character of novelty search with the exploitatory character of objective-based evolution. We show that these variants can further improve the performance of novelty search. Overall, our study shows that novelty search is a promising alternative for the evolution of controllers for robotic swarms.},

  abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting is a problem faced by many machine learning models and algorithms. When trained on one task, then trained on a second task, many machine learning models “forget” how to perform the first task. This is widely believed to be a serious problem for neural networks. Here, we investigate the extent to which the catastrophic forgetting problem occurs for modern neural networks, comparing both established and recent gradient-based training algorithms and activation functions. We also examine the effect of the relationship between the first task and the second task on catastrophic forgetting. We find that it is always best to train using the dropout algorithm–the dropout algorithm is consistently best at adapting to the new task, remembering the old task, and has the best tradeoff curve between these two extremes. We find that different tasks and relationships between tasks result in very different rankings of activation function performance. This suggests that the choice of activation function should always be cross-validated.},

  abstract = {Maximum entropy models are considered by many to be one of the most promising avenues of language modeling research. Unfortunately, long training times make maximum entropy research difficult. We present a novel speedup technique: we change the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two maximum entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and the second of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads to fewer nonzero indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving speedups of up to a factor of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It also results in typically slightly lower perplexities. The same trick can be used to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural networks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as language modeling.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been tremendous interest in the phenomenon of influence propagation in social networks. The studies in this area assume they have as input to their problems a social graph with edges labeled with probabilities of influence between users. However, the question of where these probabilities come from or how they can be computed from real social network data has been largely ignored until now. Thus it is interesting to ask whether from a social graph and a log of actions by its users, one can build models of influence. This is the main problem attacked in this paper. In addition to proposing models and algorithms for learning the model parameters and for testing the learned models to make predictions, we also develop techniques for predicting the time by which a user may be expected to perform an action. We validate our ideas and techniques using the Flickr data set consisting of a social graph with 1.3M nodes, 40M edges, and an action log consisting of 35M tuples referring to 300K distinct actions. Beyond showing that there is genuine influence happening in a real social network, we show that our techniques have excellent prediction performance.},

In this work we focus on a generalised version of typical CA, called graph cellular automata (GCA), in which the lattice structure is replaced by an arbitrary graph. In particular, we extend previous work that used convolutional neural networks to learn the transition rule of conventional CA and we use graph neural networks to learn a variety of transition rules for GCA. First, we present a general-purpose architecture for learning GCA, and we show that it can represent any arbitrary GCA with finite and discrete state space. Then, we test our approach on three different tasks: 1) learning the transition rule of a GCA on a Voronoi tessellation; 2) imitating the behaviour of a group of flocking agents; 3) learning a rule that converges to a desired target state.},

In this paper, we describe how we trained such high quality word representations for 157 languages. We used two sources of data to train these models: the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia and data from the common crawl project. We also introduce three new word analogy datasets to evaluate these word vectors, for French, Hindi and Polish. Finally, we evaluate our pre-trained word vectors on 10 languages for which evaluation datasets exists, showing very strong performance compared to previous models.},

ACT requires minimal changes to the network architecture, is deterministic and differentiable, and does not add any noise to the parameter gradients. Experimental results are provided for four synthetic problems: determining the parity of binary vectors, applying binary logic operations, adding integers, and sorting real numbers. Overall, performance is dramatically improved by the use of ACT, which successfully adapts the number of computational steps to the requirements of the problem. We also present character-level language modelling results on the Hutter prize Wikipedia dataset. In this case ACT does not yield large gains in performance; however it does provide intriguing insight into the structure of the data, with more computation allocated to harder-to-predict transitions, such as spaces between words and ends of sentences. This suggests that ACT or other adaptive computation methods could provide a generic method for inferring segment boundaries in sequence data.},

  abstract = {Foodsters United, a work-place organizing campaign by Toronto food couriers, shows that, even in the gig economy, the classic organizing methods work. The Foodsters successfully challenged their misclassification as independent contractors, got over 40 per cent of a large workforce to sign union cards, and triggered a union vote that they won with 88.8 per cent support. These victories were tempered by a devastating setback: their employer, Foodora, exited from Canadian markets. Nevertheless, what Foodsters United achieved through work-place organizing sustained its transformation into Gig Workers United, which is organizing all delivery platform workers in Toronto. Although platform companies like Foodora promote the idea that the gig economy is unprecedented, its historical continuities are more important than its discontinuities. This is also true of the work-place organizing in the gig economy. Foodsters United achieved substantial victories, not because they invented new organizing methods but because they adapted the classic methods, in often ingenious ways, to their gig economy work-place. This article is based on interviews with the campaign organizers. It is organized thematically according to classic work-place organizing methods, particularly those developed in the industrial organizing tradition, including organizing conversations, mapping, charting, leader identification, issue identification, and the creation of democratic organizations., Résumé:, Foodsters United, une campagne de syndicalisation en milieu de travail menée par des coursiers alimentaires de Toronto, montre que, même dans l'économie des petits boulots, les méthodes de syndicalisation classiques fonctionnent. Les Foodsters ont contesté avec succès leur classification erronée en tant qu'entrepreneurs indépendants, ont fait signer des cartes syndicales à plus de 40 pour cent d'une main-d'œuvre importante et ont déclenché un vote syndical qu'ils ont remporté avec 88,8 pour cent de soutien. Ces victoires ont été tempérées par un revers dévastateur: leur employeur, Foodora, s'est retiré des marchés canadiens. Néanmoins, ce que Foodsters United a réalisé grâce à l'organisation du lieu de travail a soutenu sa transformation en Gig Workers United, qui organise tous les travailleurs de la plateforme de livraison à Toronto. Bien que les sociétés de plateforme comme Foodora promeuvent l'idée que l'économie des petits boulots est sans précédent, ses continuités historiques sont plus importantes que ses discontinuités. Cela est également vrai de l'organisation du lieu de travail dans l'économie des petits boulots. Foodsters United a remporté des victoires substantielles, non pas parce qu'ils ont inventé de nouvelles méthodes d'organisation, mais parce qu'ils ont adapté les méthodes classiques, de manière souvent ingénieuse, à leur lieu de travail de l'économie des petits boulots. Cet article est basé sur des entretiens avec les organisateurs de la campagne. Il est organisé de manière thématique selon les méthodes classiques d'organisation du lieu de travail, en particulier celles développées dans la tradition d'organisation industrielle, y compris l'organisation des conversations, la cartographie, la mise en tableaux, l'identification des dirigeants, l'identification des problèmes et la création d'organisations démocratiques.}

  abstract = {An important goal in reinforcement learning is to create agents that can quickly adapt to new goals while avoiding situations that might cause damage to themselves or their environments. One way agents learn is through exploration mechanisms, which are needed to discover new policies. However, in deep reinforcement learning, exploration is normally done by injecting noise in the action space. While performing well in many domains, this setup has the inherent risk that the noisy actions performed by the agent lead to unsafe states in the environment. Here we introduce a novel approach called Meta-Learned Instinctual Networks (MLIN) that allows agents to safely learn during their lifetime while avoiding potentially hazardous states. At the core of the approach is a plastic network trained through reinforcement learning and an evolved "instinctual" network, which does not change during the agent's lifetime but can modulate the noisy output of the plastic network. We test our idea on a simple 2D navigation task with no-go zones, in which the agent has to learn to approach new targets during deployment. MLIN outperforms standard meta-trained networks and allows agents to learn to navigate to new targets without colliding with any of the no-go zones. These results suggest that meta-learning augmented with an instinctual network is a promising new approach for safe AI, which may enable progress in this area on a variety of different domains.},

  abstract = {The goal of domain generalization algorithms is to predict well on distributions different from those seen during training. While a myriad of domain generalization algorithms exist, inconsistencies in experimental conditions—datasets, architectures, and model selection criteria—render fair and realistic comparisons difficult. In this paper, we are interested in understanding how useful domain generalization algorithms are in realistic settings. As a first step, we realize that model selection is non-trivial for domain generalization tasks. Contrary to prior work, we argue that domain generalization algorithms without a model selection strategy should be regarded as incomplete. Next, we implement DOMAINBED, a testbed for domain generalization including seven multi-domain datasets, nine baseline algorithms, and three model selection criteria. We conduct extensive experiments using DOMAINBED and find that, when carefully implemented, empirical risk minimization shows state-of-the-art performance across all datasets. Looking forward, we hope that the release of DOMAINBED, along with contributions from fellow researchers, will streamline reproducible and rigorous research in domain generalization.},

  abstract = {In 1972, P.W.Anderson suggested that `More is Different', meaning that complex physical systems may exhibit behavior that cannot be understood only in terms of the laws governing their microscopic constituents. We strengthen this claim by proving that many macroscopic observable properties of a simple class of physical systems (the infinite periodic Ising lattice) cannot in general be derived from a microscopic description. This provides evidence that emergent behavior occurs in such systems, and indicates that even if a `theory of everything' governing all microscopic interactions were discovered, the understanding of macroscopic order is likely to require additional insights.},

  abstract = {The mean-field theory for cellular automata (Wolfram, and Schulman and Seiden) is generalized to the local structure theory. The local structure theory is a sequence of finitely-parameterized models of the statistical features of a cellular automaton's evolution. The nth model in the sequence takes into account correlations in terms of the probability of blocks of n states. A class of measures, the n-block measures, is introduced.The local structure operator of order n maps n-block measures to n-block measures in a manner which reflects the cellular automaton map on blocks of states. The fixed points of the map on measures approximate the invariant measures of the cellular automaton. The ability of the local structure theory to model evolution from uncorrelated initial distributions is studied. The theory gives exact results in simple cases. In more complex cases, Monte Carlo numerical experiments suggest that an accurate statistical portrait of cellular automaton evolution is obtained. The invariant measures of a cellular automaton and the stability of these measures may be obtained from the local structure theory. The local structure theory appears to be a powerful method for characterization and classification of cellular automata. Nearest neighbor cellular automata with two states per cell are studied using this method.},

We find that in a 2d exploration task, the structure of the space successfully encodes local sensory-motor contingencies such that even a greedy local ‘do the most novel action’ policy with no reinforcement learning or evolution can explore the space quickly. We also apply this to a high/low number guessing game task, and find that guessing according to the learned attention profile performs active inference and can discover the correct number more quickly than an exact but passive approach.},

  abstract = {Natural evolution gives the impression of leading to an openended process of increasing diversity and complexity. If our goal is to produce such open-endedness artificially, this suggests an approach driven by evolutionary metaphor. On the other hand, techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence are often considered too narrow to provide the sort of exploratory dynamics associated with evolution. In this paper, we hope to bridge that gap by reviewing common barriers to open-endedness in the evolution-inspired approach and how they are dealt with in the evolutionary case — collapse of diversity, saturation of complexity, and failure to form new kinds of individuality. We then show how these problems map onto similar issues in the machine learning approach, and discuss how the same insights and solutions which alleviated those barriers in evolutionary approaches can be ported over. At the same time, the form these issues take in the machine learning formulation suggests new ways to analyze and resolve barriers to open-endedness. Ultimately, we hope to inspire researchers to be able to interchangeably use evolutionary and gradient-descent-based machine learning methods to approach the design and creation of open-ended systems.},

However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts (edges) which disrupts path queries. Recent models for knowledge base completion impute missing facts by embedding knowledge graphs in vector spaces. We show that these models can be recursively applied to answer path queries, but that they suffer from cascading errors. This motivates a new "compositional" training objective, which dramatically improves all models' ability to answer path queries, in some cases more than doubling accuracy. On a standard knowledge base completion task, we also demonstrate that compositional training acts as a novel form of structural regularization, reliably improving performance across all base models (reducing errors by up to 43\%) and achieving new state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract = {Machine learning on graphs is an important and ubiquitous task with applications ranging from drug design to friendship recommendation in social networks. The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.},

Under the condition of K-separated misoperation, i.e., at each state transition at most one cell in any K-neighborhood of the cellular space can possibly misoperate, it is possible to design cellular automata which have detection capabity or correction capability.

One proposal that has been increasingly discussed by both academics and activists is the implementation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI). This would typically see all citizens awarded a regular cash payment, without conditionality attached. While UBI thus deserves considerable attention from sociologists, as yet critical theorists have not offered an extended engagement with the proposal. In this paper, I provide exactly such a critical theoretical perspective on UBI, subjecting the approach to an extended critique. When viewed through the perspective of critical theory, UBI emerges as a more problematic approach to social change, failing to offer what its most enthusiastic progressive proponents promise: ?a capitalist road to communism?. Rather, in this article, I argue that, when viewed through the lens of critical theory, UBI appears likely to further entrench, rather than disturb, the neoliberal social formation.},

This article gives a detailed discussion of the problem, including a comparison with the much better studied case of squared Euclidean cost ("the case \$p=2\$"). We present an algorithm for computing the optimal transport plan, which is similar to the approach for \$p=2\$ by Aurenhammer, Hoffmann and Aronov [Algorithmica 20, 61-76, 1998] and M\textbackslash 'erigot [Computer Graphics Forum 30, 1583--1592, 2011]. We show the necessary results to make the approach work for the Euclidean cost, evaluate its performance on a set of test cases, and give a number of applications. The later include goodness-of-fit partitions, a novel visual tool for assessing whether a finite sample is consistent with a posited probability density.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new class of time-continuous recurrent neural network models. Instead of declaring a learning system's dynamics by implicit nonlinearities, we construct networks of linear first-order dynamical systems modulated via nonlinear interlinked gates. The resulting models represent dynamical systems with varying (i.e., \textbackslash emph\{liquid\}) time-constants coupled to their hidden state, with outputs being computed by numerical differential equation solvers. These neural networks exhibit stable and bounded behavior, yield superior expressivity within the family of neural ordinary differential equations, and give rise to improved performance on time-series prediction tasks. To demonstrate these properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find bounds over their dynamics, and compute their expressive power by the \textbackslash emph\{trajectory length\} measure in a latent trajectory space. We then conduct a series of time-series prediction experiments to manifest the approximation capability of Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) compared to modern RNNs.

Our method leverages global context self-attention modules, joint with local self-attention, to effectively yet efficiently model both long and short-range spatial interactions, without the need for expensive operations such as computing attention masks or shifting local windows. In addition, we address the issue of lack of the inductive bias in ViTs via proposing to use a modified fused inverted residual blocks in our architecture. Our proposed GC ViT achieves state-of-the-art results across image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.

In this study, we propose AgentNet, a model-free data-driven framework consisting of deep neural networks to reveal and analyze the hidden interactions in complex systems from observed data alone. AgentNet utilizes a graph attention network with novel variable-wise attention to model the interaction between individual agents, and employs various encoders and decoders that can be selectively applied to any desired system. Our model successfully captured a wide variety of simulated complex systems, namely cellular automata (discrete), the Vicsek model (continuous), and active Ornstein–Uhlenbeck particles (non-Markovian) in which, notably, AgentNet’s visualized attention values coincided with the true variable-wise interaction strengths and exhibited collective behavior that was absent in the training data. A demonstration with empirical data from a flock of birds showed that AgentNet could identify hidden interaction ranges exhibited by real birds, which cannot be detected by conventional velocity correlation analysis. We expect our framework to open a novel path to investigating complex systems and to provide insight into general process-driven modeling.},

  abstract = {The control of compliant robots is, due to their often nonlinear and complex dynamics, inherently difficult. The vision of morphological computation proposes to view these aspects not only as problems, but rather also as parts of the solution. Non-rigid body parts are not seen anymore as imperfect realizations of rigid body parts, but rather as potential computational resources. The applicability of this vision has already been demonstrated for a variety of complex robot control problems. Nevertheless, a theoretical basis for understanding the capabilities and limitations of morphological computation has been missing so far. We present a model for morphological computation with compliant bodies, where a precise mathematical characterization of the potential computational contribution of a complex physical body is feasible. The theory suggests that complexity and nonlinearity, typically unwanted properties of robots, are desired features in order to provide computational power. We demonstrate that simple generic models of physical bodies, based on mass-spring systems, can be used to implement complex nonlinear operators. By adding a simple readout (which is static and linear) to the morphology such devices are able to emulate complex mappings of input to output streams in continuous time. Hence, by outsourcing parts of the computation to the physical body, the difficult problem of learning to control a complex body, could be reduced to a simple and perspicuous learning task, which can not get stuck in local minima of an error function.},

  abstract = {The political economy of Britain over the past three decades provides an interesting example of the consolidation, normalization and institutionalization of a new economic paradigm – neoliberalism. As such, it serves as a potentially instructive focus for debate both about the conditions under which economic paradigms are replaced and consolidated and the evolution of such paradigms through the process of institutionalization. In this paper I suggest that the institutionalization of this new economic paradigm has been associated with the shift from a normative to a normalized and necessitarian neoliberalism. I examine the role played by rationalist assumptions in this extended process of normalization-institutionalization. After presenting a stylized account of the evolution of British neoliberalism, I show how New Labour's monetary policy regime is the heir to the legacy of monetarism and its agenda of labour-market reform is the heir to Thatcherism's supply-side economics. I suggest that the time-inconsistency thesis and the business school globalization thesis have played an equivalent role, for New Labour, to that played for the new right by monetarism and supply-side economics in legitimating neoliberalism. In this way neoliberalism has been normalized. In the final sections of the paper I reflect on the implications of the normalized and necessitarian character of neoliberalism in Britain for its contestability and for democratic economic governance more broadly.},

The results of this research are several complex and long running update rules and the objective function parameters that produced them. Several update rules produced from this paper exhibit complex emergent behavior through patterns, such as spaceships, guns, oscillators, and Universal Turing Machines.

We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task.

  abstract = {Investigation of the brain's functional connectome can improve our understanding of how an individual brain's organizational changes influence cognitive function and could result in improved individual risk stratification. Brain connectome studies in adults and older children have shown that abnormal network properties may be useful as discriminative features and have exploited machine learning models for early diagnosis in a variety of neurological conditions. However, analogous studies in neonates are rare and with limited significant findings. In this paper, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN) framework for early prediction of cognitive deficits in very preterm infants based on functional connectome data from resting state fMRI. Specifically, we conducted feature selection via stacked sparse autoencoder and outcome prediction via support vector machine (SVM). The proposed ANN model was unsupervised learned using brain connectome data from 884 subjects in autism brain imaging data exchange database and SVM was cross-validated on 28 very preterm infants (born at 23–31\,weeks of gestation and without brain injury; scanned at term-equivalent postmenstrual age). Using 90 regions of interests, we found that the ANN model applied to functional connectome data from very premature infants can predict cognitive outcome at 2\,years of corrected age with an accuracy of 70.6\% and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76. We also noted that several frontal lobe and somatosensory regions, significantly contributed to prediction of cognitive deficits 2\,years later. Our work can be considered as a proof of concept for utilizing ANN models on functional connectome data to capture the individual variability inherent in the developing brains of preterm infants. The full potential of ANN will be realized and more robust conclusions drawn when applied to much larger neuroimaging datasets, as we plan to do.},

The goal of this kind of adversarial attack is to modify the input text to fool a classifier while maintaining the original meaning of the text. Although most existing adversarial attacks claim to fulfill the constraint of semantics preservation, careful scrutiny shows otherwise. We show that the problem lies in the text encoders used to determine the similarity of adversarial examples, specifically in the way they are trained. Unsupervised training methods make these encoders more susceptible to problems with antonym recognition. To overcome this, we introduce a simple, fully supervised sentence embedding technique called Semantics-Preserving-Encoder (SPE). The results show that our solution minimizes the variation in the meaning of the adversarial examples generated. It also significantly improves the overall quality of adversarial examples, as confirmed by human evaluators. Furthermore, it can be used as a component in any existing attack to speed up its execution while maintaining similar attack success.},

We set out to develop a powerful and robust predictor for therapy resistance for intensively treated adult patients. We used two large gene expression data sets (n=856) to develop a predictor of therapy resistance, which was validated in an independent cohort analyzed by RNA sequencing (n=250). In addition to gene expression markers, standard clinical and laboratory variables as well as the mutation status of 68 genes were considered during construction of the model. The final predictor (PS29MRC) consisted of 29 gene expression markers and a cytogenetic risk classification. A continuous predictor is calculated as a weighted linear sum of the individual variables. In addition, a cut off was defined to divide patients into a high-risk and a low-risk group for resistant disease. PS29MRC was highly significant in the validation set, both as a continuous score (OR=2.39, P=8.63·10-9, AUC=0.76) and as a dichotomous classifier (OR=8.03, P=4.29·10-9); accuracy was 77\%. In multivariable models, only TP53 mutation, age and PS29MRC (continuous: OR=1.75, P=0.0011; dichotomous: OR=4.44, P=0.00021) were left as significant variables. PS29MRC dominated all models when compared with currently used predictors, and also predicted overall survival independently of established markers. When integrated into the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 genetic risk stratification, four groups (median survival of 8, 18, 41 months, and not reached) could be defined (P=4.01·10-10). PS29MRC will make it possible to design trials which stratify induction treatment according to the probability of response, and refines the ELN 2017 classification.},

Predation is hypothesized as one selective pressure that may have driven the evolution of multicellularity. Here we show that de novo origins of simple multicellularity can evolve in response to predation. We subjected outcrossed populations of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to selection by the filter-feeding predator Paramecium tetraurelia. Two of five experimental populations evolved multicellular structures not observed in unselected control populations within \textasciitilde 750 asexual generations. Considerable variation exists in the evolved multicellular life cycles, with both cell number and propagule size varying among isolates. Survival assays show that evolved multicellular traits provide effective protection against predation. These results support the hypothesis that selection imposed by predators may have played a role in some origins of multicellularity.},

  abstract = {An autoencoder network uses a set of recognition weights to convert an input vector into a code vector. It then uses a set of generative weights to convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input vector. We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The aim is to minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and the reconstruction error. We show that this information is minimized by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distribution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible code vector given the input vector. Unfortunately, if the code vectors use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors. We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder can be used to compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this approximation gives an upper bound on the description length. Even when this bound is poor, it can be used as a Lyapunov function for learning both the generative and the recognition weights. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to learn factorial codes.},

The learning procedures must be capable of modifying the connection strengths in such a way that internal units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain. Several interesting gradient-descent procedures have recently been discovered. Each connection computes the derivative, with respect to the connection strength, of a global measure of the error in the performance of the network. The strength is then adjusted in the direction that decreases the error. These relatively simple, gradient-descent learning procedures work well for small tasks and the new challenge is to find ways of improving their convergence rate and their generalization abilities so that they can be applied to larger, more realistic tasks.},

  abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

We find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over \textbackslash nummodels language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, \textbackslash chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as \textbackslash gopher but with 70B parameters and 4\$\textbackslash times\$ more more data. \textbackslash chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms \textbackslash Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that \textbackslash chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, \textbackslash chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5\textbackslash\% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7\textbackslash\% improvement over \textbackslash gopher.},

  abstract = {When investigating theories at the tiniest conceivable scales in nature, almost all researchers today revert to the quantum language, accepting the verdict from the Copenhagen doctrine that the only way to describe what is going on will always involve states in Hilbert space, controlled by operator equations. Returning to classical, that is, non quantum mechanical, descriptions will be forever impossible, unless one accepts some extremely contrived theoretical constructions that may or may not reproduce the quantum mechanical phenomena observed in experiments. Dissatisfied, this author investigated how one can look at things differently. This book is an overview of older material, but also contains many new observations and calculations. Quantum mechanics is looked upon as a tool, not as a theory. Examples are displayed of models that are classical in essence, but can be analysed by the use of quantum techniques, and we argue that even the Standard Model, together with gravitational interactions, might be viewed as a quantum mechanical approach to analyse a system that could be classical at its core. We explain how such thoughts can conceivably be reconciled with Bell's theorem, and how the usual objections voiced against the notion of `superdeterminism' can be overcome, at least in principle. Our proposal would eradicate the collapse problem and the measurement problem. Even the existence of an "arrow of time" can perhaps be explained in a more elegant way than usual. Discussions added in v3: the role of the gravitational force, a mathematical physics definition of free will, and an unconventional view on the arrow of time, amongst others.},

  abstract = {Morphological regeneration is an important feature that highlights the environmental adaptive capacity of biological systems. Lack of this regenerative capacity significantly limits the resilience of machines and the environments they can operate in. To aid in addressing this gap, we develop an approach for simulated soft robots to regrow parts of their morphology when being damaged. Although numerical simulations using soft robots have played an important role in their design, evolving soft robots with regenerative capabilities have so far received comparable little attention. Here we propose a model for soft robots that regenerate through a neural cellular automata. Importantly, this approach only relies on local cell information to regrow damaged components, opening interesting possibilities for physical regenerable soft robots in the future. Our approach allows simulated soft robots that are damaged to partially regenerate their original morphology through local cell interactions alone and regain some of their ability to locomote. These results take a step towards equipping artificial systems with regenerative capacities and could potentially allow for more robust operations in a variety of situations and environments.

In this article, we study the dynamics of an in silico chemical network with random connectivity in an environment that makes strong thermodynamic forcing available only to rare combinations of chemical concentrations.

MobileNetV3 is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardwareaware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances. This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and network design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for release: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases. These models are then adapted and applied to the tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation. For the task of semantic segmentation (or any dense pixel prediction), we propose a new efficient segmentation decoder Lite Reduced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP). We achieve new state of the art results for mobile classification, detection and segmentation. MobileNetV3-Large is 3.2\% more accurate on ImageNet classification while reducing latency by 20\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Small is 6.6\% more accurate compared to a MobileNetV2 model with comparable latency. MobileNetV3-Large detection is over 25\% faster at roughly the same accuracy as MobileNetV2 on COCO detection.

  abstract = {The behavioural diversity seen in biological systems is, at the most basic level, driven by interactions between physical materials and their environment. In this context, we investigate the a-life properties of falling paper systems, in which different paper shapes are dropped into free fall and their behaviours observed. These systems have a simple embodiment but highly complex interactions with the environment. Using a synthetic methodology, i.e. understanding by building, we explore how morphology can be used to program certain interactions into the dynamics of a free-falling V-shaped paper. We demonstrate that morphology can encode a stochastic hierarchy of possible behaviours into the system. This hierarchy can be described by a set of conditional switching probabilities and represented in a morphological ‘state machine’. We draw a parallel with developmental processes, showing how these can emerge from interaction with the environment. Next, we demonstrate how Bayesian optimisation can be used to optimise morphology in response to a fitness function, in this case minimizing falling speed. Bayesian optimisation allows us to capture the system stochasticity with minimal sampling. By manipulating non-living raw materials such as paper, we are able to analyse how morphology can be used to control and program interactions with the environment. With this bottom-up approach we ultimately aim to demonstrate principles that turn materials into agents that show non-trivial behaviours comparable to those of living organisms.}

  abstract = {Background The current acute kidney injury (AKI) risk prediction model for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) employed regression techniques. This study aimed to evaluate whether models using machine learning techniques could significantly improve AKI risk prediction after PCI. Methods and findings We used the same cohort and candidate variables used to develop the current NCDR CathPCI Registry AKI model, including 947,091 patients who underwent PCI procedures between June 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011. The mean age of these patients was 64.8 years, and 32.8\% were women, with a total of 69,826 (7.4\%) AKI events. We replicated the current AKI model as the baseline model and compared it with a series of new models. Temporal validation was performed using data from 970,869 patients undergoing PCIs between July 1, 2016, and March 31, 2017, with a mean age of 65.7 years; 31.9\% were women, and 72,954 (7.5\%) had AKI events. Each model was derived by implementing one of two strategies for preprocessing candidate variables (preselecting and transforming candidate variables or using all candidate variables in their original forms), one of three variable-selection methods (stepwise backward selection, lasso regularization, or permutation-based selection), and one of two methods to model the relationship between variables and outcome (logistic regression or gradient descent boosting). The cohort was divided into different training (70\%) and test (30\%) sets using 100 different random splits, and the performance of the models was evaluated internally in the test sets. The best model, according to the internal evaluation, was derived by using all available candidate variables in their original form, permutation-based variable selection, and gradient descent boosting. Compared with the baseline model that uses 11 variables, the best model used 13 variables and achieved a significantly better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.752 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.749–0.754) versus 0.711 (95\% CI 0.708–0.714), a significantly better Brier score of 0.0617 (95\% CI 0.0615–0.0618) versus 0.0636 (95\% CI 0.0634–0.0638), and a better calibration slope of observed versus predicted rate of 1.008 (95\% CI 0.988–1.028) versus 1.036 (95\% CI 1.015–1.056). The best model also had a significantly wider predictive range (25.3\% versus 21.6\%, p {$<$} 0.001) and was more accurate in stratifying AKI risk for patients. Evaluated on a more contemporary CathPCI cohort (July 1, 2015–March 31, 2017), the best model consistently achieved significantly better performance than the baseline model in AUC (0.785 versus 0.753), Brier score (0.0610 versus 0.0627), calibration slope (1.003 versus 1.062), and predictive range (29.4\% versus 26.2\%). The current study does not address implementation for risk calculation at the point of care, and potential challenges include the availability and accessibility of the predictors. Conclusions Machine learning techniques and data-driven approaches resulted in improved prediction of AKI risk after PCI. The results support the potential of these techniques for improving risk prediction models and identification of patients who may benefit from risk-mitigation strategies.},

  abstract = {Self-reproduction in cellular automata has been extensively studied over the decades, with the aim of exploring the underlying logic structure of reproduction behind living organisms. Most efforts to date, however, are concentrated on how to yield rigid copies of self-replicating structures virtually in the cellular space, whereby even a tiny disturbance occurring around a loop is likely to prevent the loop from completing its reproduction. As with reproduction, self-adaptation is another fundamental feature of biology, which aids in enhancing an organism’s ability of living and reproduction in various environments, via the use of natural sensing and selection. Based upon a natural and greedy-like selection scheme, this paper proposes a novel type of self-reproducing loops that can evolve to gradually adapt their structures to fit the changing environments. Experiments demonstrate that such self-adaptability can actually offer more opportunities for loops to survive and reproduce in a wide variety of regions. In particular, self-adaptation may facilitate the emergence of a remarkable diversity in self-replicating structures, even when the whole reproductions start from a single loop, thereby possibly increasing the maximum occupancy of the cellular space by the population of all loops.},

  abstract = {In order to develop systems capable of artificial evolution, we need to identify which systems can produce complex behavior. We present a novel classification method applicable to any class of deterministic discrete space and time dynamical systems. The method is based on classifying the asymptotic behavior of the average computation time in a given system before entering a loop. We were able to identify a critical region of behavior that corresponds to a phase transition from ordered behavior to chaos across various classes of dynamical systems. To show that our approach can be applied to many different computational systems, we demonstrate the results of classifying cellular automata, Turing machines, and random Boolean networks. Further, we use this method to classify 2D cellular automata to automatically find those with interesting, complex dynamics. We believe that our work can be used to design systems in which complex structures emerge. Also, it can be used to compare various versions of existing attempts to model open-ended evolution (Channon, 2006; Ofria \&amp; Wilke, 2004; Ray, 1991).},

An important open problem for continual learning is a large-scale benchmark which enable realistic evaluation of algorithms. In this paper, we study a natural setting for continual learning on a massive scale. We introduce the problem of personalized online language learning (POLL), which involves fitting personalized language models to a population of users that evolves over time. To facilitate research on POLL, we collect massive datasets of Twitter posts. These datasets, Firehose10M and Firehose100M, comprise 100 million tweets, posted by one million users over six years. Enabled by the Firehose datasets, we present a rigorous evaluation of continual learning algorithms on an unprecedented scale. Based on this analysis, we develop a simple algorithm for continual gradient descent (ConGraD) that outperforms prior continual learning methods on the Firehose datasets as well as earlier benchmarks. Collectively, the POLL problem setting, the Firehose datasets, and the ConGraD algorithm enable a complete benchmark for reproducible research on web-scale continual learning.},

  abstract = {Cellular automata are a class of spatially and temporally discrete mathematical systems characterized by local interaction and synchronous dynamical evolution. Introduced by the mathematician John von Neumann in the 1950s as simple models of biological self-reproduction, they are prototypical models for complex systems and processes consisting of a large number of simple, homogeneous, locally interacting components. Cellular automata have been the focus of great attention over the years because of their ability to generate a rich spectrum of very complex patterns of behavior out of sets of relatively simple underlying rules. Moreover, they appear to capture many essential features of complex self-organizing cooperative behavior observed in real systems.This book provides a summary of the basic properties of cellular automata, and explores in depth many important cellular-automata-related research areas, including artificial life, chaos, emergence, fractals, nonlinear dynamics, and self-organization. It also presents a broad review of the speculative proposition that cellular automata may eventually prove to be theoretical harbingers of a fundamentally new information-based, discrete physics. Designed to be accessible at the junior/senior undergraduate level and above, the book will be of interest to all students, researchers, and professionals wanting to learn about order, chaos, and the emergence of complexity. It contains an extensive bibliography and provides a listing of cellular automata resources available on the World Wide Web.},

The WM of a self-referential NN, however, can keep rapidly modifying all of itself during runtime. In principle, such NNs can meta-learn to learn, and metameta-learn to meta-learn to learn, and so on, in the sense of recursive self-improvement. While NN architectures potentially capable of implementing such behavior have been proposed since the ’90s, there have been few if any practical studies. Here we revisit such NNs, building upon recent successes of fast weight programmers and closely related linear Transformers. We propose a scalable self-referential WM (SRWM) that uses outer products and the delta update rule to modify itself. We evaluate our SRWM in supervised few-shot learning and in multi-task reinforcement learning with procedurally generated game environments. Our experiments demonstrate both practical applicability and competitive performance of the proposed SRWM. Our code is public†.},

In contrast to these approaches, in this article we propose a polymorphic neural circuit that allows the dynamic change of its properties according to the current situation in real time to be employed instead. To this end, the concept of neuromodulation is introduced. To verify the feasibility of this approach, this concept is applied to the control of a three-dimensional biped robot that is intrinsically unstable. The importance of an adaptive controller is illustrated with the simulations of biped walking on uneven terrain, and the results show that the biped robot successfully copes with environmental perturbation by dynamically changing the torque outputs applied to the joints. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms a monolithic CPG model with sensory feedback.},

This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.},

Using nearest neighbor, one-dimensional Cellular Automata (CA) as an example, we show how to construct local coarse-grained descriptions of CA in all classes of Wolfram's classification. The resulting coarse-grained CA that we construct are capable of emulating the large-scale behavior of the original systems without accounting for small-scale details. Several CA that can be coarse-grained by this construction are known to be universal Turing machines; they can emulate any CA or other computing devices and are therefore undecidable. We thus show that because in practice one only seeks coarse-grained information, complex physical systems can be predictable and even decidable at some level of description. The renormalization group flows that we construct induce a hierarchy of CA rules. This hierarchy agrees well with apparent rule complexity and is therefore a good candidate for a complexity measure and a classification method. Finally we argue that the large scale dynamics of CA can be very simple, at least when measured by the Kolmogorov complexity of the large scale update rule, and moreover exhibits a novel scaling law. We show that because of this large-scale simplicity, the probability of finding a coarse-grained description of CA approaches unity as one goes to increasingly coarser scales. We interpret this large scale simplicity as a pattern formation mechanism in which large scale patterns are forced upon the system by the simplicity of the rules that govern the large scale dynamics.},

  abstract = {Echo state networks (ESN) are a novel approach to recurrent neural network training. An ESN consists of a large, fixed, recurrent "reservoir" network, from which the desired output is obtained by training suitable output connection weights. Determination of optimal output weights becomes a linear, uniquely solvable task of MSE minimization. This article reviews the basic ideas and describes an online adaptation scheme based on the RLS algorithm known from adaptive linear systems. As an example, a 10-th order NARMA system is adaptively identified. The known benefits of the RLS algorithms carry over from linear systems to nonlinear ones; specifically, the convergence rate and misadjustment can be determined at design time.}

However, training of such networks is often difficult and time consuming. In this work, we show how Reservoir Computing Networks (RCNs) can be used for detecting purposes on raw images. The applicability of RCNs is illustrated using two example challenges, namely isolated digit handwriting recognition on the MNIST dataset as well as detection of the status of a door using self-developed moving pictures from a surveillance camera. Achieving an error rate of 0.92 percent on MNIST, we show that RCN can be a serious competitor to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we show how RCNs with their simple and yet robust training procedure can be practically used for real surveillance tasks using very low resolution camera sensors.},

We, first, analyze bag-of-features in the framework of approximate nearest neighbor search. This shows the suboptimality of such a representation for matching descriptors and leads us to derive a more precise representation based on 1) Hamming embedding (HE) and 2) weak geometric consistency constraints (WGC). HE provides binary signatures that refine the matching based on visual words. WGC filters matching descriptors that are not consistent in terms of angle and scale. HE and WGC are integrated within the inverted file and are efficiently exploited for all images, even in the case of very large datasets. Experiments performed on a dataset of one million of images show a significant improvement due to the binary signature and the weak geometric consistency constraints as well as their efficiency. Estimation of the full geometric transformation, i.e., a re-ranking step on a short list of images, is complementary to our weak geometric consistency constraints and allows to further improve the accuracy.},

It has the potential to significantly improve the theory and practice of modelling, designing and implementing complex systems. Yet, to date, there has been little systematic analysis of what makes an agent such an appealing and powerful conceptual model. Moreover, even less effort has been devoted to exploring the inherent disadvantages that stem from adopting an agent-oriented view. Here both sets of issues are explored. The standpoint of this analysis is the role of agent-based software in solving complex, real-world problems. In particular, it will be argued that the development of robust and scalable software systems requires autonomous agents that can complete their objectives while situated in a dynamic and uncertain environment, that can engage in rich, high-level social interactions, and that can operate within flexible organisational structures.},

  abstract = {Artificial spin ice (ASI) are systems of coupled nanomagnets arranged on a 2D lattice. ASIs are promising computing substrates due to the rich variety of emergent behavior, accompanied by considerable control and flexibility. Computational models may exploit the small-scale dynamics of the individual elements, or large-scale emergent behavior of the resulting metamaterial. We investigate the computational capabilities of “pinwheel” ASI, whose emergent ferromagnetic patterns can be observed at different scales. Within a reservoir computing framework, we examine how key system parameters affect performance using well-established reservoir quality metrics. As reservoir output, we consider system state at different granularities, ranging from individual magnets to the collective state of multiple magnets. Our results show that pinwheel ASI exhibits excellent computing capacity, including evidence of fading memory. Interestingly, a wide range of output granularities result in good performance, offering new insights into the scalability and robustness of reservoirs based on self-organized collective behavior. The apparent flexibility in output granularity show that ASIs have computational properties at different abstraction levels, from the small-scale dynamics of simple elements, to the large-scale spatial patterns of the metamaterial.},

  abstract = {A number of text mining and information extraction projects such as TextRunner and NELL seek to automatically build knowledge bases from the rapidly growing amount of information on the web. In order to scale to the size of the web, these projects often employ ad hoc heuristics to reason about uncertain and contradictory information rather than reasoning jointly about all candidate facts. In this paper, we present a Markov logic-based system for cleaning an extracted knowledge base. This allows a scalable system such as NELL to take advantage of joint probabilistic inference, or, conversely, allows Markov logic to be applied to a web scale problem. Our system uses only the ontological constraints and confidence values of the original system, along with humanlabeled data if available. The labeled data can be used to calibrate the confidence scores from the original system or learn the effectiveness of individual extraction patterns. To achieve scalability, we introduce a neighborhood grounding method that only instantiates the part of the network most relevant to the given query. This allows us to partition the knowledge cleaning task into tractable pieces that can be solved individually. In experiments on NELL’s knowledge base, we evaluate several variants of our approach and find that they improve both F1 and area under the precision-recall curve.},

  abstract = {Graph-based neural network models are producing strong results in a number of domains, in part because graphs provide flexibility to encode domain knowledge in the form of relational structure (edges) between nodes in the graph. In practice, edges are used both to represent intrinsic structure (e.g., abstract syntax trees of programs) and more abstract relations that aid reasoning for a downstream task (e.g., results of relevant program analyses). In this work, we study the problem of learning to derive abstract relations from the intrinsic graph structure. Motivated by their power in program analyses, we consider relations defined by paths on the base graph accepted by a finite-state automaton. We show how to learn these relations end-to-end by relaxing the problem into learning finite-state automata policies on a graph-based POMDP and then training these policies using implicit differentiation. The result is a differentiable Graph Finite-State Automaton (GFSA) layer that adds a new edge type (expressed as a weighted adjacency matrix) to a base graph. We demonstrate that this layer can find shortcuts in grid-world graphs and reproduce simple static analyses on Python programs. Additionally, we combine the GFSA layer with a larger graph-based model trained end-to-end on the variable misuse program understanding task, and find that using the GFSA layer leads to better performance than using hand-engineered semantic edges or other baseline methods for adding learned edge types.},

These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.},

  abstract = {Quality Diversity algorithms (QD) evolve a set of high-performing phenotypes that each behaves as differently as possible. However, current algorithms are all elitist, which make them unable to cope with stochastic fitness functions and behavior evaluations. In fact, many of the promising applications of QD algorithms, for instance, games and robotics, are stochastic. Here we propose two new extensions to the QD-algorithm MAP-Elites --- adaptive sampling and drifting-elites --- and demonstrate empirically that these extensions increase the quality of solutions in a noisy artificial test function and the behavioral diversity in a 2D bipedal walker environment.},

  abstract = {Adaptation is an important capability in a fast-changing world. What factors allow an animal population to adapt to external changes in their environments? What effects do those changes have on the animal populations that do adapt? This paper explores these questions in the context of intraspecies communication in a noisy soundscape. Using a simulated soundscape and populations generated using Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), the same scenario is played through many times to understand the range of possible outcomes given an initial population and a set of noise conditions. While noise is found to have minimal effect on the best possible scenario, it affects how often that scenario is reached. The onset of noise is also found to impact the complexity of the evolved neural networks.}

However, the computational cost of reinforcement learning with deep neural networks is extremely high and reducing the learning cost is a challenging issue. We propose a photonic on-line implementation of reinforcement learning using optoelectronic delay-based reservoir computing, both experimentally and numerically. In the proposed scheme, we accelerate reinforcement learning at a rate of several megahertz because there is no required learning process for the internal connection weights in reservoir computing. We perform two benchmark tasks, CartPole-v0 and MountanCar-v0 tasks, to evaluate the proposed scheme. Our results represent the first hardware implementation of reinforcement learning based on photonic reservoir computing and pave the way for fast and efficient reinforcement learning as a novel photonic accelerator.},

  abstract = {Transformers have outperformed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural language generation. This comes with a significant computational overhead, as the attention mechanism scales with a quadratic complexity in sequence length. Efficient transformer variants have received increasing interest from recent works. Among them, a linear-complexity recurrent variant has proven well suited for autoregressive generation. It approximates the softmax attention with randomized or heuristic feature maps, but can be difficult to train or yield suboptimal accuracy. This work aims to convert a pretrained transformer into its efficient recurrent counterpart, improving the efficiency while retaining the accuracy. Specifically, we propose a swap-then-finetune procedure: in an off-the-shelf pretrained transformer, we replace the softmax attention with its linear-complexity recurrent alternative and then finetune. With a learned feature map, our approach provides an improved tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy over the standard transformer and other recurrent variants. We also show that the finetuning process needs lower training cost than training these recurrent variants from scratch. As many recent models for natural language tasks are increasingly dependent on large-scale pretrained transformers, this work presents a viable approach to improving inference efficiency without repeating the expensive pretraining process.},

To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O N 2 to O (N ), where N is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.},

  abstract = {A major scientific revolution has begun, a new paradigm that rivals Darwin's theory in importance. At its heart is the discovery of the order that lies deep within the most complex of systems, from the origin of life, to the workings of giant corporations, to the rise and fall of great civilizations. And more than anyone else, this revolution is the work of one man, Stuart Kauffman, a MacArthur Fellow and visionary pioneer of the new science of complexity. Now, in At Home in the Universe, Kauffman brilliantly weaves together the excitement of intellectual discovery and a fertile mix of insights to give the general reader a fascinating look at this new science--and at the forces for order that lie at the edge of chaos. We all know of instances of spontaneous order in nature--an oil droplet in water forms a sphere, snowflakes have a six-fold symmetry. What we are only now discovering, Kauffman says, is that the range of spontaneous order is enormously greater than we had supposed. Indeed, self-organization is a great undiscovered principle of nature. But how does this spontaneous order arise? Kauffman contends that complexity itself triggers self-organization, or what he calls "order for free," that if enough different molecules pass a certain threshold of complexity, they begin to self-organize into a new entity--a living cell. Kauffman uses the analogy of a thousand buttons on a rug--join two buttons randomly with thread, then another two, and so on. At first, you have isolated pairs; later, small clusters; but suddenly at around the 500th repetition, a remarkable transformation occurs--much like the phase transition when water abruptly turns to ice--and the buttons link up in one giant network. Likewise, life may have originated when the mix of different molecules in the primordial soup passed a certain level of complexity and self-organized into living entities (if so, then life is not a highly improbable chance event, but almost inevitable). Kauffman uses the basic insight of "order for free" to illuminate a staggering range of phenomena. We see how a single-celled embryo can grow to a highly complex organism with over two hundred different cell types. We learn how the science of complexity extends Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection: that self-organization, selection, and chance are the engines of the biosphere. And we gain insights into biotechnology, the stunning magic of the new frontier of genetic engineering--generating trillions of novel molecules to find new drugs, vaccines, enzymes, biosensors, and more. Indeed, Kauffman shows that ecosystems, economic systems, and even cultural systems may all evolve according to similar general laws, that tissues and terra cotta evolve in similar ways. And finally, there is a profoundly spiritual element to Kauffman's thought. If, as he argues, life were bound to arise, not as an incalculably improbable accident, but as an expected fulfillment of the natural order, then we truly are at home in the universe. Kauffman's earlier volume, The Origins of Order, written for specialists, received lavish praise. Stephen Jay Gould called it "a landmark and a classic." And Nobel Laureate Philip Anderson wrote that "there are few people in this world who ever ask the right questions of science, and they are the ones who affect its future most profoundly. Stuart Kauffman is one of these." In At Home in the Universe, this visionary thinker takes you along as he explores new insights into the nature of life.},

  abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting in neural networks is a significant problem for continual learning. A majority of the current methods replay previous data during training, which violates the constraints of an ideal continual learning system. Additionally, current approaches that deal with forgetting ignore the problem of catastrophic remembering, i.e. the worsening ability to discriminate between data from different tasks. In our work, we introduce Relevance Mapping Networks (RMNs) which are inspired by the Optimal Overlap Hypothesis. The mappings reflects the relevance of the weights for the task at hand by assigning large weights to essential parameters. We show that RMNs learn an optimized representational overlap that overcomes the twin problem of catastrophic forgetting and remembering. Our approach achieves state-ofthe-art performance across all common continual learning datasets, even significantly outperforming data replay methods while not violating the constraints for an ideal continual learning system. Moreover, RMNs retain the ability to detect data from new tasks in an unsupervised manner, thus proving their resilience against catastrophic remembering.},

This work describes an evolutionary framework for the search of a CA with these properties. Instead of encoding them directly into the fitness function, we propose one, which maximises the variance of entropy across the CA grid. This fitness function promotes the existence of areas on the verge of chaos, where life is expected to thrive. The results are reported for the case of CA in which cells are in one of four possible states. We also describe a mechanism for fitness sharing that successfully speeds up the genetic search, both in terms of number of generations and CPU time.},

This is based on the statistical prediction techniques developed by Crutchfield et al. and generates so called causal state models, equivalent in structure to hidden Markov models. The new method is applicable to any continuous data which clusters around discrete values and exhibits multiple transitions between these values such as tethered particle motion data or Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) spectra. The algorithms developed have been shown to perform well on simulated data, demonstrating the ability to recover the model used to generate the data under high noise, sparse data conditions and the ability to infer the existence of degenerate states. They have also been applied to new experimental FRET data of Holliday Junction dynamics, extracting the expected two state model and providing values for the transition rates in good agreement with previous results and with results obtained using existing maximum likelihood based methods. The method differs markedly from previous Markov-model reconstructions in being able to uncover truly hidden states.},

In particular, we focus on scenarios where we have to be able to classify large quantities of data quickly. We investigate various methods for performing multi-modal fusion and analyze their trade-offs in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings indicate that the inclusion of continuous information improves performance over text-only on a range of multi-modal classification tasks, even with simple fusion methods. In addition, we experiment with discretizing the continuous features in order to speed up and simplify the fusion process even further. Our results show that fusion with discretized features outperforms text-only classification, at a fraction of the computational cost of full multimodal fusion, with the additional benefit of improved interpretability.},

  abstract = {From logical reasoning to mental simulation, biological and artificial neural systems possess an incredible capacity for computation. Such neural computers offer a fundamentally novel computing paradigm by representing data continuously and processing information in a natively parallel and distributed manner. To harness this computation, prior work has developed extensive training techniques to understand existing neural networks. However, the lack of a concrete and low-level programming language for neural networks precludes us from taking full advantage of a neural computing framework. Here, we provide such a programming language using reservoir computing—a simple recurrent neural network—and close the gap between how we conceptualize and implement neural computers and silicon computers. By decomposing the reservoir’s internal representation and dynamics into a symbolic basis of its inputs, we define a low-level neural machine code that we use to program the reservoir to solve complex equations and store chaotic dynamical systems as random access memory (dRAM). Using this representation, we provide a fully distributed neural implementation of software virtualization and logical circuits, and even program a playable game of pong inside of a reservoir computer. Taken together, we define a concrete, practical, and fully generalizable implementation of neural computation.},

  abstract = {Interacting systems are prevalent in nature, from dynamical systems in physics to complex societal dynamics. The interplay of components can give rise to complex behavior, which can often be explained using a simple model of the system's constituent parts. In this work, we introduce the neural relational inference (NRI) model: an unsupervised model that learns to infer interactions while simultaneously learning the dynamics purely from observational data. Our model takes the form of a variational auto-encoder, in which the latent code represents the underlying interaction graph and the reconstruction is based on graph neural networks. In experiments on simulated physical systems, we show that our NRI model can accurately recover ground-truth interactions in an unsupervised manner. We further demonstrate that we can find an interpretable structure and predict complex dynamics in real motion capture and sports tracking data.},

We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks which they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on the MNIST hand written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.},

Our Variable Shared Meta Learning (VS-ML) unifies the above and demonstrates that simple weight-sharing and sparsity in an NN is sufficient to express powerful learning algorithms (LAs) in a reusable fashion. A simple implementation of VS-ML called VS-ML RNN allows for implementing the backpropagation LA solely by running an RNN in forward-mode. It can even meta-learn new LAs that improve upon backpropagation and generalize to datasets outside of the meta training distribution without explicit gradient calculation. Introspection reveals that our meta-learned LAs learn qualitatively different from gradient descent through fast association.},

  abstract = {Novelty search is a recently proposed method for evolutionary computation designed to avoid the problem of deception, in which the fitness function guides the search process away from global optima. Novelty search replaces fitness-based selection with novelty-based selection, where novelty is measured by comparing an individual's behavior to that of the current population and an archive of past novel individuals. Though there is substantial evidence that novelty search can overcome the problem of deception, the critical factors in its performance remain poorly understood. This paper helps to bridge this gap by analyzing how the behavior function, which maps each genotype to a behavior, affects performance. We propose the notion of descendant fitness probability (DFP), which describes how likely a genotype's descendants are to have a certain fitness, and formulate two hypotheses about when changes to the behavior function will improve novelty search's performance, based on the effect of those changes on behavior and DFP. Experiments in both artificial and deceptive maze domains provide substantial empirical support for these hypotheses.},

  abstract = {In the emerging Internet of things cyber-physical system-embedded society, big data analytics needs huge computing capability with better energy efficiency. Coming to the end of Moore’s law of the electronic integrated circuit and facing the throughput limitation in parallel processing governed by Amdahl’s law, there is a strong motivation behind exploring a novel frontier of data processing in post-Moore era. Optical fiber transmissions have been making a remarkable advance over the last three decades. A record aggregated transmission capacity of the wavelength division multiplexing system per a single-mode fiber has reached 115 Tbit/s over 240 km. It is time to turn our attention to data processing by photons from the data transport by photons. A photonic accelerator (PAXEL) is a special class of processor placed at the front end of a digital computer, which is optimized to perform a specific function but does so faster with less power consumption than an electronic general-purpose processor. It can process images or time-serial data either in an analog or digital fashion on a real-time basis. Having had maturing manufacturing technology of optoelectronic devices and a diverse array of computing architectures at hand, prototyping PAXEL becomes feasible by leveraging on, e.g., cutting-edge miniature and power-efficient nanostructured silicon photonic devices. In this article, first the bottleneck and the paradigm shift of digital computing are reviewed. Next, we review an array of PAXEL architectures and applications, including artificial neural networks, reservoir computing, pass-gate logic, decision making, and compressed sensing. We assess the potential advantages and challenges for each of these PAXEL approaches to highlight the scope for future work toward practical implementation.},

  abstract = {Various non-classical approaches of distributed information processing, such as neural networks, computation with Ising models, reservoir computing, vector symbolic architectures, and others, employ the principle of collective-state computing. In this type of computing, the variables relevant in a computation are superimposed into a single high-dimensional state vector, the collective-state. The variable encoding uses a fixed set of random patterns, which has to be stored and kept available during the computation. Here we show that an elementary cellular automaton with rule 90 (CA90) enables space-time tradeoff for collective-state computing models that use random dense binary representations, i.e., memory requirements can be traded off with computation running CA90. We investigate the randomization behavior of CA90, in particular, the relation between the length of the randomization period and the size of the grid, and how CA90 preserves similarity in the presence of the initialization noise. Based on these analyses we discuss how to optimize a collective-state computing model, in which CA90 expands representations on the fly from short seed patterns - rather than storing the full set of random patterns. The CA90 expansion is applied and tested in concrete scenarios using reservoir computing and vector symbolic architectures. Our experimental results show that collective-state computing with CA90 expansion performs similarly compared to traditional collective-state models, in which random patterns are generated initially by a pseudo-random number generator and then stored in a large memory.},

  abstract = {Neural network has a critical problem, called catastrophic forgetting, where memories for tasks already learned are easily overwritten with memories for a task additionally learned. This problem interferes with continual learning required for autonomous robots, which learn many tasks incrementally from daily activities. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting, it is important for especially reservoir computing to clarify which neurons should be fired corresponding to each task, since only readout weights are updated according to the degree of firing of neurons. We therefore propose the way to design reservoir computing such that the firing neurons are clearly distinguished from others according to the task to be performed. As a key design feature, we employ fractal network, which has modularity and scalability, to be reservoir layer. In particular, its modularity is fully utilized by designing input layer. As a result, simulations of control tasks using reinforcement learning show that our design mitigates the catastrophic forgetting even when random actions from reinforcement learning prompt parameters to be overwritten. Furthermore, learning multiple tasks with a single network suggests that knowledge for the other tasks can facilitate to learn a new task, unlike the case using completely different networks.},

We train the model efficiently using REINFORCE with a simple and robust baseline based on a deterministic (greedy) rollout of the best policy so far. We significantly improve over results from previous works that consider learned heuristics for the TSP, reducing the optimality gap for a single tour construction from 1.51\% to 0.32\% for instances with 20 nodes, from 4.59\% to 1.71\% for 50 nodes and from 6.89\% to 4.43\% for 100 nodes.

When viewed in this way, the process of solving these problems becomes equivalent to searching a space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program. The recently developed genetic programming paradigm described herein provides a way to search the space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program to solve (or approximately solve) a surprising variety of different problems from different fields. In genetic programming, populations of computer programs are genetically bred using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest and using a genetic crossover (sexual recombination) operator appropriate for genetically mating computer programs. Genetic programming is illustrated via an example of machine learning of the Boolean 11-multiplexer function and symbolic regression of the econometric exchange equation from noisy empirical data.},

  abstract = {Despite the near universal assumption of individuality in biology, there is little agreement about what individuals are and few rigorous quantitative methods for their identification. Here, we propose that individuals are aggregates that preserve a measure of temporal integrity, i.e., “propagate” information from their past into their futures. We formalize this idea using information theory and graphical models. This mathematical formulation yields three principled and distinct forms of individuality—an organismal, a colonial, and a driven form—each of which varies in the degree of environmental dependence and inherited information. This approach can be thought of as a Gestalt approach to evolution where selection makes figure-ground (agent–environment) distinctions using suitable information-theoretic lenses. A benefit of the approach is that it expands the scope of allowable individuals to include adaptive aggregations in systems that are multi-scale, highly distributed, and do not necessarily have physical boundaries such as cell walls or clonal somatic tissue. Such individuals might be visible to selection but hard to detect by observers without suitable measurement principles. The information theory of individuality allows for the identification of individuals at all levels of organization from molecular to cultural and provides a basis for testing assumptions about the natural scales of a system and argues for the importance of uncertainty reduction through coarse-graining in adaptive systems.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

Answering this question requires a model that can first explain the emergence of evolvable units, namely, structures that (1) preserve themselves in time (2) self-reproduce and (3) can tolerate a certain amount of variation when reproducing. To tackle this challenge, here we introduce Combinatory Chemistry, an Algorithmic Artificial Chemistry based on a simple computational paradigm named Combinatory Logic. The dynamics of this system comprise very few rules, it is initialized with an elementary tabula rasa state, and features conservation laws replicating natural resource constraints. Our experiments show that a single run of this dynamical system discovers a wide range of emergent patterns with no external intervention. All these structures rely on acquiring basic constituents from the environment and decomposing them in a process that is remarkably similar to biological metabolisms. These patterns involve autopoietic structures that maintain their organisation, recursive ones that grow in linear chains or binary-branching trees, and most notably, patterns able to reproduce themselves, duplicating their number at each generation.},

Artificial chemistries are one of the most important tools for this purpose because they provide us with a basic framework to investigate under which conditions metabolisms capable of reproducing themselves, and ultimately, of evolving, can emerge. While there have been successful attempts at producing examples of emergent self-reproducing metabolisms, the set of rules involved remain too complex to shed much light on the underlying principles at work. In this article, we hypothesize that the key property needed for self-reproducing metabolisms to emerge is the existence of an autocatalyzed subset of Turing-complete reactions. We validate this hypothesis with a minimalistic artificial chemistry with conservation laws, which is based on a Turing-complete rewriting system called combinatory logic. Our experiments show that a single run of this chemistry, starting from a tabula rasa state, discovers—with no external intervention—a wide range of emergent structures including ones that self-reproduce in each cycle. All of these structures take the form of recursive algorithms that acquire basic constituents from the environment and decompose them in a process that is remarkably similar to biological metabolisms.},

DeblurGAN-v2 is based on a relativistic conditional GAN with a double-scale discriminator. For the first time, we introduce the Feature Pyramid Network into deblurring, as a core building block in the generator of DeblurGAN-v2. It can flexibly work with a wide range of backbones, to navigate the balance between performance and efficiency. The plug-in of sophisticated backbones (e.g., Inception-ResNet-v2) can lead to solid state-of-the-art deblurring. Meanwhile, with light-weight backbones (e.g., MobileNet and its variants), DeblurGAN-v2 reaches 10-100 times faster than the nearest competitors, while maintaining close to state-of-the-art results, implying the option of real-time video deblurring. We demonstrate that DeblurGAN-v2 obtains very competitive performance on several popular benchmarks, in terms of deblurring quality (both objective and subjective), as well as efficiency. Besides, we show the architecture to be effective for general image restoration tasks too. Our codes, models and data are available at: https://github.com/KupynOrest/DeblurGANv2},

The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover's Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error rates.},

Tools for automatically aligning these knowledge bases would make it possible to unify many sources of structured knowledge and answer complex queries. However, the efficient alignment of large-scale knowledge bases still poses a considerable challenge. Here, we present Simple Greedy Matching (SiGMa), a simple algo-rithm for aligning knowledge bases with millions of entities and facts. SiGMa is an iterative propagation algorithm which leverages both the structural information from the relationship graph as well as flexible similarity measures between entity properties in a greedy local search, thus making it scalable. Despite its greedy nature, our experiments indicate that SiGMa can efficiently match some of the world's largest knowledge bases with high accuracy. We provide additional ex-periments on benchmark datasets which demonstrate that SiGMa can outperform state-of-the-art approaches both in accuracy and efficiency.},

Traditional text classifiers often rely on many human-designed features, such as dictionaries, knowledge bases and special tree kernels. In contrast to traditional methods, we introduce a recurrent convolutional neural network for text classification without human-designed features. In our model, we apply a recurrent structure to capture contextual information as far as possible when learning word representations, which may introduce considerably less noise compared to traditional window-based neural networks. We also employ a max-pooling layer that automatically judges which words play key roles in text classification to capture the key components in texts. We conduct experiments on four commonly used datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several datasets, particularly on document-level datasets.},

Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a self-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks with multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and \textbackslash squad benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.

The conclusion is drawn that although the capacity for universal construction is a sufficient condition for self-reproduction, it is not a necessary condition. Slightly more “liberal” criteria for what constitutes genuine self-reproduction are introduced, and a simple self-reproducing structure is exhibited which satisfies these new criteria. This structure achieves its simplicity by storing its description in a dynamic “loop”, rather than on a static “tape”.},

In this paper we look into the possibility that life could emerge from the interaction of inanimate artificial molecules. Cellular automata provide us with the logical universes within which we can embed artificial molecules in the form of propagating, virtual automata. We suggest that since virtual automata have the computational capacity to fill many of the functional roles played by the primary biomolecules, there is a strong possibility that the ‘molecular logic’ of life can be embedded within cellular automata and that, therefore, artificial life is a distinct possibility within these highly parallel computer structures.},

We show that a soft inference procedure based on a combination of constrained, weighted, random walks through the knowledge base graph can be used to reliably infer new beliefs for the knowledge base. More specifically, we show that the system can learn to infer different target relations by tuning the weights associated with random walks that follow different paths through the graph, using a version of the Path Ranking Algorithm (Lao and Cohen, 2010b). We apply this approach to a knowledge base of approximately 500,000 beliefs extracted imperfectly from the web by NELL, a never-ending language learner (Carlson et al., 2010). This new system improves significantly over NELL’s earlier Horn-clause learning and inference method: it obtains nearly double the precision at rank 100, and the new learning method is also applicable to many more inference tasks.},

This graph representation enables a number of scientific tasks such as ad hoc retrieval or named entity recognition (NER) to be formulated as typed proximity queries in the graph. One popular proximity measure is called Random Walk with Restart (RWR), and much work has been done on the supervised learning of RWR measures by associating each edge label with a parameter. In this paper, we describe a novel learnable proximity measure which instead uses one weight per edge label sequence: proximity is defined by a weighted combination of simple “path experts”, each corresponding to following a particular sequence of labeled edges. Experiments on eight tasks in two subdomains of biology show that the new learning method significantly outperforms the RWR model (both trained and untrained). We also extend the method to support two additional types of experts to model intrinsic properties of entities: query-independent experts, which generalize the PageRank measure, and popular entity experts which allow rankings to be adjusted for particular entities that are especially important.},

Therefore, we propose a new method for predicting the computational performance of neural microcircuit models. The new measure estimates directly the kernel property and the generalization capability of a neural microcircuit. We validate the proposed measure by comparing its prediction with direct evaluations of the computational performance of various neural microcircuit models. The proposed method also allows us to quantify differences in the computational performance and generalization capability of neural circuits in different dynamic regimes (UP- and DOWN-states) that have been demonstrated through intracellular recordings in vivo.},

This can be accomplished via a learning mechanism applied to each individual robot: for practical reasons, such a mechanism should be both sample and time-efficient. In this paper, We investigate two ways to improve the sample and time efficiency of the well-known learner CMA-ES on navigation tasks. The first approach combines CMA-ES with Novelty Search, and includes an adaptive restart mechanism with increasing population size. The second bootstraps CMA-ES using Bayesian Optimisation, known for its sample efficiency. Results using two robots built with the ARE project's modules and four environments show that novelty reduces the number of samples needed to converge, as does the custom restart mechanism; the latter also has better sample and time efficiency than the hybridised Bayesian/Evolutionary method.},

  abstract = {In evolutionary computation, the fitness function normally measures progress toward an objective in the search space, effectively acting as an objective function. Through deception, such objective functions may actually prevent the objective from being reached. While methods exist to mitigate deception, they leave the underlying pathology untreated: Objective functions themselves may actively misdirect search toward dead ends. This paper proposes an approach to circumventing deception that also yields a new perspective on open-ended evolution. Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling natural evolution to capture open-endedness, the idea is to simply search for behavioral novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective. Because many points in the search space collapse to a single behavior, the search for novelty is often feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. By decoupling open-ended search from artificial life worlds, the search for novelty is applicable to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the maze navigation and biped walking tasks in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objectivebased search, suggesting the strange conclusion that some problems are best solved by methods that ignore the objective. The main lesson is the inherent limitation of the objective-based paradigm and the unexploited opportunity to guide search through other means.},

  abstract = {A significant challenge in genetic programming is premature convergence to local optima, which often prevents evolution from solving problems. This paper introduces to genetic programming a method that originated in neuroevolution (i.e. the evolution of artificial neural networks) that circumvents the problem of deceptive local optima. The main idea is to search only for behavioral novelty instead of for higher fitness values. Although such novelty search abandons following the gradient of the fitness function, if such gradients are deceptive they may actually occlude paths through the search space towards the objective. Because there are only so many ways to behave, the search for behavioral novelty is often computationally feasible and differs significantly from random search. Counterintuitively, in both a deceptive maze navigation task and the artificial ant benchmark task, genetic programming with novelty search, which ignores the objective, outperforms traditional genetic programming that directly searches for optimal behavior. Additionally, novelty search evolves smaller program trees in every variation of the test domains. Novelty search thus appears less susceptible to bloat, another significant problem in genetic programming. The conclusion is that novelty search is a viable new tool for efficiently solving some deceptive problems in genetic programming.},

To verify this result, two of these models are replicated, one based on a deep neural network (DNN) and one on facial morphology (FM). Using a new dataset of 20,910 photographs from dating websites, the ability to predict sexual orientation is confirmed (DNN accuracy male 68\%, female 77\%, FM male 62\%, female 72\%). To investigate whether facial features such as brightness or predominant colours are predictive of sexual orientation, a new model based on highly blurred facial images was created. This model was also able to predict sexual orientation (male 63\%, female 72\%). The tested models are invariant to intentional changes to a subject's makeup, eyewear, facial hair and head pose (angle that the photograph is taken at). It is shown that the head pose is not correlated with sexual orientation. While demonstrating that dating profile images carry rich information about sexual orientation these results leave open the question of how much is determined by facial morphology and how much by differences in grooming, presentation and lifestyle. The advent of new technology that is able to detect sexual orientation in this way may have serious implications for the privacy and safety of gay men and women.},

BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and many other more recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of the original sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE and SQuAD, achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 6 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also report ablation experiments that replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to better measure which factors most influence end-task performance.},

  abstract = {Language models have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks that require natural language understanding. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art models have generally struggled with tasks that require quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematics, science, and engineering problems at the college level. To help close this gap, we introduce Minerva, a large language model pretrained on general natural language data and further trained on technical content. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on technical benchmarks without the use of external tools. We also evaluate our model on over two hundred undergraduate-level problems in physics, biology, chemistry, economics, and other sciences that require quantitative reasoning, and find that the model can correctly answer nearly a third of them.},

In this paper DNN is considered as a discrete-time dynamical system due to its layered structure. The complexity provided by the nonlinearity in the DNN dynamics is analyzed in terms of topological entropy and chaos characterized by Lyapunov exponents. The properties revealed for the dynamics of DNN are applied to analyze the corresponding capabilities of classification and generalization. In particular, for both the hyperbolic tangent function and the rectified linear units (ReLU), the Lyapunov exponents are both positive given proper DNN parameters, which implies the chaotic behavior of the dynamics. Moreover, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of DNN is also analyzed, based on the layered and recursive structure. The conclusions from the viewpoint of dynamical systems are expected to open a new dimension for the understanding of DNN.},

  abstract = {Novelty search is a recent algorithm geared toward exploring search spaces without regard to objectives. When the presence of constraints divides a search space into feasible space and infeasible space, interesting implications arise regarding how novelty search explores such spaces. This paper elaborates on the problem of constrained novelty search and proposes two novelty search algorithms which search within both the feasible and the infeasible space. Inspired by the FI-2pop genetic algorithm, both algorithms maintain and evolve two separate populations, one with feasible and one with infeasible individuals, while each population can use its own selection method. The proposed algorithms are applied to the problem of generating diverse but playable game levels, which is representative of the larger problem of procedural game content generation. Results show that the two-population constrained novelty search methods can create, under certain conditions, larger and more diverse sets of feasible game levels than current methods of novelty search, whether constrained or unconstrained. However, the best algorithm is contingent on the particularities of the search space and the genetic operators used. Additionally, the proposed enhancement of offspring boosting is shown to enhance performance in all cases of two-population novelty search.},

However, such models pose a great challenge in resource-constrained scenarios owing to their large memory requirements and high latency. To alleviate this issue, we propose to jointly distill and quantize the model, where knowledge is transferred from the full-precision teacher model to the quantized and distilled low-precision student model. Empirical analyses show that, despite the challenging nature of generative tasks, we were able to achieve a 16.5x model footprint compression ratio with little performance drop relative to the full-precision counterparts on multiple summarization and QA datasets. We further pushed the limit of compression ratio to 27.7x and presented the performance-efficiency trade-off for generative tasks using pre-trained models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work aiming to effectively distill and quantize sequence-to-sequence pre-trained models for language generation tasks.},

  abstract = {Interest in biologically inspired alternatives to backpropagation is driven by the desire to both advance connections between deep learning and neuroscience and address backpropagation's shortcomings on tasks such as online, continual learning. However, local synaptic learning rules like those employed by the brain have so far failed to match the performance of backpropagation in deep networks. In this study, we employ meta-learning to discover networks that learn using feedback connections and local, biologically inspired learning rules. Importantly, the feedback connections are not tied to the feedforward weights, avoiding biologically implausible weight transport. Our experiments show that meta-trained networks effectively use feedback connections to perform online credit assignment in multi-layer architectures. Surprisingly, this approach matches or exceeds a state-of-the-art gradient-based online meta-learning algorithm on regression and classification tasks, excelling in particular at continual learning. Analysis of the weight updates employed by these models reveals that they differ qualitatively from gradient descent in a way that reduces interference between updates. Our results suggest the existence of a class of biologically plausible learning mechanisms that not only match gradient descent-based learning, but also overcome its limitations.},

In many knowledge graphs (KG), some relations indicate attributes of entities (attributes) and others indicate relations between entities (relations). Existing KR models regard all relations equally, and usually suffer from poor accuracies when modeling one-to-many and many-to-one relations, mostly composed of attribute. In this paper, we distinguish existing KGrelations into attributes and relations, and propose a new KR model with entities, attributes and relations (KR-EAR). The experiment results show that, by special modeling of attribute, KR-EAR can significantly outperform state-of-the-art KR models in prediction of entities, attributes and relations.

Such resolution is a central step in constructing high-quality knowledge graph from unstructured text. Previous research has tackled this problem by making use of various textual and structural features from a semantic dictionary or a knowledge graph. This may lead to poor performance on knowledge mentions with poor or not well-known contexts. In addition, it is also limited by the coverage of the semantic dictionary or knowledge graph. In this work, we propose ETransR, a method which automatically learns entity and relation feature representations in continuous vector spaces, in order to measure the semantic relatedness of knowledge mentions for knowledge resolution. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that our proposed method delivers significant improvements compared with the state-of-the-art baselines on the task of knowledge resolution.},

  abstract = {Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising research direction that has the potential to replace expert-designed networks with learned, task-specific architectures. In this work, in order to help ground the empirical results in this field, we propose new NAS baselines that build off the following observations: (i) NAS is a specialized hyperparameter optimization problem; and (ii) random search is a competitive baseline for hyperparameter optimization. Leveraging these observations, we evaluate both random search with early-stopping and a novel random search with weight-sharing algorithm on two standard NAS benchmarks—PTB and CIFAR-10. Our results show that random search with early-stopping is a competitive NAS baseline, e.g., it performs at least as well as ENAS [41], a leading NAS method, on both benchmarks. Additionally, random search with weight-sharing outperforms random search with early-stopping, achieving a state-of-the-art NAS result on PTB and a highly competitive result on CIFAR-10. Finally, we explore the existing reproducibility issues of published NAS results. We note the lack of source material needed to exactly reproduce these results, and further discuss the robustness of published results given the various sources of variability in NAS experimental setups. Relatedly, we provide all information (code, random seeds, documentation) needed to exactly reproduce our results, and report our random search with weight-sharing results for each benchmark on multiple runs.},

With this, our approach can learn to outperform custom-written solutions for a variety of problems, as we tested it on sorting, searching in ordered lists and the NP-complete 0/1 knapsack problem, which sets a notable milestone in the field of Neural Program Induction. As highlights, our learned model can perform sorting perfectly on any input data size we tested on, with \$O(n log n)\$ complexity, whilst outperforming hand-coded algorithms, including quick sort, in number of operations even for list sizes far beyond those seen during training.},

We present mBART -- a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora in many languages using the BART objective. mBART is one of the first methods for pre-training a complete sequence-to-sequence model by denoising full texts in multiple languages, while previous approaches have focused only on the encoder, decoder, or reconstructing parts of the text. Pre-training a complete model allows it to be directly fine tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and unsupervised machine translation, with no task-specific modifications. We demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised models. We also show it also enables new types of transfer to language pairs with no bi-text or that were not in the pre-training corpus, and present extensive analysis of which factors contribute the most to effective pre-training.},

Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes, and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD.

  abstract = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \textbackslash textbf\{S\}hifted \textbackslash textbf\{win\}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

To address the problem, we make a shared-latent space assumption and propose an unsupervised image-to-image translation framework based on Coupled GANs. We compare the proposed framework with competing approaches and present high quality image translation results on various challenging unsupervised image translation tasks, including street scene image translation, animal image translation, and face image translation.

The form of the measure is uniquely fixed by the requirement that it be a continuous, additive function of the processes that can result in a state. Applied to a Hamiltonian system, the measure is equal to the difference between the system's coarse- and fine-grained entropy, a quantity that we call thermodynamic depth. The measure satisfies the intuitive requirements that wholly ordered and wholly random systems are not thermodynamically deep and that a complex object together with a copy is not much deeper than the object alone. Applied to systems capable of computation, the measure yields a conventional computational measure of complexity as a special case. The relation of depth and thermodynamic depth to previously proposed definitions of complexity is discussed, and applications to physical, chemical, and mathematical problems are proposed.},

They are usually affected by changes in the data distribution, giving rise to a phenomenon referred to as concept drift. Thus, learning models must detect and adapt to such changes, so as to exhibit a good predictive performance after a drift has occurred. In this regard, the development of effective drift detection algorithms becomes a key factor in data stream mining. In this work we propose CU RIE, a drift detector relying on cellular automata. Specifically, in CU RIE the distribution of the data stream is represented in the grid of a cellular automata, whose neighborhood rule can then be utilized to detect possible distribution changes over the stream. Computer simulations are presented and discussed to show that CU RIE, when hybridized with other base learners, renders a competitive behavior in terms of detection metrics and classification accuracy. CU RIE is compared with well-established drift detectors over synthetic datasets with varying drift characteristics.},

To better understand this issue, we study the problem of continual learning, where the model observes, once and one by one, examples concerning a sequence of tasks. First, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate models learning over a continuum of data. These metrics characterize models not only by their test accuracy, but also in terms of their ability to transfer knowledge across tasks. Second, we propose a model for continual learning, called Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) that alleviates forgetting, while allowing beneficial transfer of knowledge to previous tasks. Our experiments on variants of the MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate the strong performance of GEM when compared to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {In this review, we discuss modularity and hierarchy in biological systems. We review examples from protein structure, genetics, and biological networks of modular partitioning of the geometry of biological space. We review theories to explain modular organization of biology, with a focus on explaining how biology may spontaneously organize to a structured form. That is, we seek to explain how biology nucleated from among the many possibilities in chemistry. The emergence of modular organization of biological structure will be described as a symmetry-breaking phase transition, with modularity as the order parameter. Experimental support for this description will be reviewed. Examples will be presented from pathogen structure, metabolic networks, gene networks, and protein-protein interaction networks. Additional examples will be presented from ecological food networks, developmental pathways, physiology, and social networks. There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who manufactured very fine watches. Both of them were highly regarded, and the phones in their workshops rang frequently — new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered, while Tempus became poorer and poorer and finally lost his shop. What was the reason? The watches the men made consisted of about 1,000 parts each. Tempus had so constructed his that if he had one partly assembled and had to put it down — to answer the phone say— it immediately fell to pieces and had to be reassembled from the elements. The better the customers liked his watches, the more they phoned him, the more difficult it became for him to find enough uninterrupted time to finish a watch. The watches that Hora made were no less complex than those of Tempus. But he had designed them so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten elements each. Ten of these subassemblies, again, could be put together into a larger subassembly; and a system of ten of the latter sub-assemblies constituted the whole watch. Hence, when Hora had to put down a partly assembled watch in order to answer the phone, he lost only a small part of his work, and he assembled his watches in only a fraction of the man-hours it took Tempus.”H.

  abstract = {It is quite difficult to construct circuits of spiking neurons that can carry out complex computational tasks. On the other hand even randomly connected circuits of spiking neurons can in principle be used for complex computational tasks such as time-warp invariant speech recognition. This is possible because such circuits have an inherent tendency to integrate incoming information in such a way that simple linear readouts can be trained to transform the current circuit activity into the target output for a very large number of computational tasks. Consequently we propose to analyze circuits of spiking neurons in terms of their roles as analog fading memory and non-linear kernels, rather than as implementations of specific computational operations and algorithms. This article is a sequel to [W. Maass, T. Natschläger, H. Markram, Real-time computing without stable states: a new framework for neural computation based on perturbations, Neural Comput. 14 (11) (2002) 2531-2560, Online available as \#130 from: ], and contains new results about the performance of generic neural microcircuit models for the recognition of speech that is subject to linear and non-linear time-warps, as well as for computations on time-varying firing rates. These computations rely, apart from general properties of generic neural microcircuit models, just on capabilities of simple linear readouts trained by linear regression. This article also provides detailed data on the fading memory property of generic neural microcircuit models, and a quick review of other new results on the computational power of such circuits of spiking neurons.},

  abstract = {Neural networks appear to have mysterious generalization properties when using parameter counting as a proxy for complexity. Indeed, neural networks often have many more parameters than there are data points, yet still provide good generalization performance. Moreover, when we measure generalization as a function of parameters, we see double descent behaviour, where the test error decreases, increases, and then again decreases. We show that many of these properties become understandable when viewed through the lens of effective dimensionality, which measures the dimensionality of the parameter space determined by the data. We relate effective dimensionality to posterior contraction in Bayesian deep learning, model selection, width-depth tradeoffs, double descent, and functional diversity in loss surfaces, leading to a richer understanding of the interplay between parameters and functions in deep models. We also show that effective dimensionality compares favourably to alternative norm- and flatness- based generalization measures.},

It reduces superfluous – microscopic – degrees of freedom. Israeli and Goldenfeld demonstrated in [1,2] that the coarse-graining can be employed for elementary cellular automata (CA), producing interesting interdependences between them. However, extending their investigation on more complex CA rules appeared to be impossible due to the high computational complexity of the coarse-graining algorithm. We demonstrate here that this complexity can be substantially decreased. It allows for scrutinizing much broader class of cellular automata in terms of their coarse graining. By using our algorithm we found out that the ratio of the numbers of elementary CAs having coarse grained representation to “degenerate” – irreducible – cellular automata, strongly increases with increasing the “grain” size of the approximation procedure. This rises principal questions about the formal limits in modeling of realistic multiscale systems.},

  abstract = {Until recently the state of the art in lossless data compression was prediction by partial match (PPM). A PPM model estimates the next-symbol probability distribution by combining statistics from the longest matching contiguous contexts in which each symbol value is found. We introduce a context mixing model which improves on PPM by allowing contexts which are arbitrary functions of the history. Each model independently estimates a probability and confidence that the next bit of data will be 0 or 1. Predictions are combined by weighted averaging. After a bit is arithmetic coded, the weights are adjusted along the cost gradient in weight space to favor the most accurate models. Context mixing compressors, as implemented by the open source PAQ project, are now top ranked on several independent benchmarks.},

  abstract = {A decade after speech was first decoded from human brain signals, accuracy and speed remain far below that of natural speech. Here we show how to decode the electrocorticogram with high accuracy and at natural-speech rates. Taking a cue from recent advances in machine translation, we train a recurrent neural network to encode each sentence-length sequence of neural activity into an abstract representation, and then to decode this representation, word by word, into an English sentence. For each participant, data consist of several spoken repeats of a set of 30–50 sentences, along with the contemporaneous signals from \textasciitilde 250 electrodes distributed over peri-Sylvian cortices. Average word error rates across a held-out repeat set are as low as 3\%. Finally, we show how decoding with limited data can be improved with transfer learning, by training certain layers of the network under multiple participants’ data. Makin and colleagues decode speech from neural signals recorded during a preoperative procedure, using an algorithm inspired by machine translation. For one participant reading from a closed set of 50 sentences, decoding accuracy is nearly perfect.},

The underwhelming success of the models suggests that there must be more to open-ended evolution than just unbounded evolutionary activity as the term is currently defined.

  abstract = {In this study, we are providing a recurrent architecture based on Cellular Automata state evolution. The states of the cells are used as the reservoir of activities as in Echo State Networks. The projection of the input onto this reservoir medium provides a systematic way of remembering previous inputs and combining the memory with a continuous stream of inputs. This is an essential capability for a wide collection of intelligence tasks such as language, continuous vision (i.e. video), symbolic manipulation in a knowledge base etc. We devise intuitive methods for enlarging the memory capacity of the cellular autmata state space and reducing the interference between memory traces. Cellular Automata reservoir constructs a novel bridge between computational theory of automata and neural architectures. The proposed framework is tested on classical synthetic pathological tasks that are widely used in evaluating recurrent algorithms. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves zero error in all tasks, giving a similar performance with Echo State Networks, but even better in many different aspects. Two other methods are also introduced to training recurrent neural networks; “Covariance representation” that has second order attribute statistics and “Stack representation” that has a local representation, and compare them with Cellular Automata based Reservoir Comuting framework that has higher attribute statistics and distributed representation. This raises the question of whether real valued neuron units are essential for solving complex problems that are distributed over time. Our results suggest that, even very sparsely connected binary units with simple computational rules can provide the required computation for intelligent behavior.}

ReCA has been tested using pathological synthetic sequence tasks (well-known benchmark tasks within the reservoir computing (RC) community) and has been showing promising results that reduce complexity compared with other RC approaches such as echo state networks (ESNs). In this paper, a number of methods for feature extraction from the cellular automata (CA) reservoir are introduced to improve ReCA by reducing its complexity while maintaining accuracy. The proposed method reduces the feature dimension by using a few states from every time step (EACH) in the reservoir and/or using only one side of the CA evolution (HALF) and/or reducing the CA evolution in space (expansion ratio ƒ). Due to the rich dynamics of the CA reservoir, the three methods of reduction (EACH, HALF, and ƒ) can be used together to reduce the feature dimension by up to 98\% in some pathological tasks compared with the state-of-the-art ReCA results.}

This neuromorphic approach is based on a new paradigm of a brain-inspired computational unit, intrinsically differing from Turing machines. This recent paradigm consists in expanding the input information to be processed into a higher dimensional phase space, through the nonlinear transient response of a complex dynamics excited by the input information. The computed output is then extracted via a linear separation of the transient trajectory in the complex phase space. The hyperplane separation is derived from a learning phase consisting of the resolution of a regression problem. The processing capability originates from the nonlinear transient, resulting in nonlinear transient computing. The computational performance is successfully evaluated on a standard benchmark test, namely, a spoken digit recognition task.},

A cell switches its state 0 to state 1 if one of its two neighbors is in state 1 (propagation of a perturbation) and a cell remains in state 1 only if its two neighbors are in state 0. A lateral inhibition is because a 1-state neighbor causes a 1-state cell to switch to state 0. The rule produces a rich spectrum of space-time dynamics, including gliders and glider guns just from four primitive gliders. We construct a catalogue of gliders and describe them by tiles. We calculate a subset of regular expressions \$\textbackslash Psi\_\{R54\}\$ to encode gliders. The regular expressions are derived from de Bruijn diagrams, tile-based representation of gliders, and cycle diagrams sometimes. We construct an abstract machine that recognizes regular expressions of gliders in rule 54 and validate \$\textbackslash Psi\_\{R54\}\$. We also propose a way to code initial configurations of gliders to depict any type of collision between the gliders and explore self-organization of gliders, formation of larger tiles, and soliton-like interactions of gliders and computable devices.},

The existing methods are based on feed-forward networks, while recurrent neural network differential equation solvers have not yet been reported. We introduce an unsupervised reservoir computing (RC), an echo-state recurrent neural network capable of discovering approximate solutions that satisfy ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We suggest an approach to calculate time derivatives of recurrent neural network outputs without using backpropagation. The internal weights of an RC are fixed, while only a linear output layer is trained, yielding efficient training. However, RC performance strongly depends on finding the optimal hyper-parameters, which is a computationally expensive process. We use Bayesian optimization to efficiently discover optimal sets in a high-dimensional hyper-parameter space and numerically show that one set is robust and can be used to solve an ODE for different initial conditions and time ranges. A closed-form formula for the optimal output weights is derived to solve first order linear equations in a backpropagation-free learning process. We extend the RC approach by solving nonlinear system of ODEs using a hybrid optimization method consisting of gradient descent and Bayesian optimization. Evaluation of linear and nonlinear systems of equations demonstrates the efficiency of the RC ODE solver.},

  abstract = {The fundamental feature that characterizes living systems is autonomy, and any account of their organization as systems that can exist as individual unities must show what autonomy is as a phenomenon proper to them, and how it arises in their operation as such unities. Accordingly the following is proposed. (1) That autonomy in living systems is a feature of self-production (autopoiesis), and that a living system is properly characterized only as a network of processes of production of components that is continuously, and recursively, generated and realized as a concrete entity (unity) in the physical space, by the interactions of the same components that it produces as such a network. This organization I call the autopoietic organization, and any system that exhibits it is an autopoietic system in the space in which its components exist; in this sense living systems are autopoietic systems in the physical space. (2) That the basic consequence of the autopoietic organization is that everything that takes place in an autopoietic system is subordinated to the realization of its autopoiesis, otherwise it disintegrates. (3) That the fundamental feature that characterizes the nervous system is that it is a closed network of interacting neurons in which every state of neuronal activity generates other states of neuronal activity. Since the nervous system is a component subsystem in an autopoietic unity, it operates by generating states of relative neuronal activity that participate in the realization of the autopoiesis of the organism which it integrates. (4) That the autopoietic states that an organism adopts are determined by its structure (the structure of the nervous system included), and that the structure of the organism (including its nervous system) is at any instant the result of its evolutionary and ontogenic structural coupling with the medium in which it is autopoietic, obtained while the autopoiesis is realized. (5) That language arises as phenomenon proper to living systems from the reciprocal structural coupling of at least two organisms with nervous systems, and that self-consciousness arises as an individual phenomenon from the recursive structural coupling of an organism with language with its own structure through recursive self-description.},

Experiments show that MAT performs competitively on a diverse set of molecular prediction tasks. Most importantly, with a simple self-supervised pretraining, MAT requires tuning of only a few hyperparameter values to achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks.

CAs are cell-based state machines, which evolve in time in accordance with local rules based on a cell's current state and those of its neighbors. Notably, simple single cell shift rules as the memory rule in a fixed edge CA afforded reasonable success in conjunction with a variety of projection rules, potentially significantly reducing the optimal solution search space. Optimal iteration counts for the CA rule pairs can be estimated for some tasks based upon the category of the projection rule. Initial results support future hardware realization, where CAs potentially afford orders of magnitude reduction in size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements compared with floating point RC implementations.},

  abstract = {A framework for implementing reservoir computing (RC) and extreme learning machines (ELMs), two types of artificial neural networks, based on 1D elementary Cellular Automata (CA) is presented, in which two separate CA rules explicitly implement the minimum computational requirements of the reservoir layer: hyperdimensional projection and short-term memory. CAs are cell-based state machines, which evolve in time in accordance with local rules based on a cell's current state and those of its neighbors. Notably, simple single cell shift rules as the memory rule in a fixed edge CA afforded reasonable success in conjunction with a variety of projection rules, potentially significantly reducing the optimal solution search space. Optimal iteration counts for the CA rule pairs can be estimated for some tasks based upon the category of the projection rule. Initial results support future hardware realization, where CAs potentially afford orders of magnitude reduction in size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements compared with floating point RC implementations.},

  abstract = {There are many significant research projects focused on providing semantic web repositories that are scalable and efficient. However, the true value of the semantic web architecture is its ability to represent meaningful knowledge and not just data. Therefore, a semantic web knowledge base should do more than retrieve collections of triples. We propose RDFKB (Resource Description Knowledge Base), a complete semantic web knowledge case. RDFKB is a solution for managing, persisting and querying semantic web knowledge. Our experiments with real world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that RDFKB achieves superior query performance to other stateof-the-art solutions. The key features of RDFKB that differentiate it from other solutions are: 1) a simple and efficient process for data additions, deletions and updates that does not involve reprocessing the dataset; 2) materialization of inferred triples at addition time without performance degradation; 3) materialization of uncertain information and support for queries involving probabilities; 4) distributed inference across datasets; 5) ability to apply alignments to the dataset and perform queries against multiple sources using alignment. RDFKB allows more knowledge to be stored and retrieved; it is a repository not just for RDF datasets, but also for inferred triples, probability information, and lineage information. RDFKB provides a complete and efficient RDF data repository and knowledge base.},

The paucity of evidence raises the question of what sustains the consensus, and a number of suggestions are offered, including the possibility that certain cultural and/or perceptual biases are at work.

  abstract = {Biofilm is a self-assembling microbial community that can serve as a model system for studying emergent collective dynamics of living systems. Bacillus subtilis biofilms resolve a conflict between interior and peripheral cells by electrical signaling and oscillatory colony-growth dynamics. Intriguingly, this dynamics maintain the interior-cell populations within a biofilm, which ultimately improves the survivability against antibacterial treatments as a whole. Beyond intra-biofilm coordination, two biofilms in a microfluidic device can coordinate their oscillatory phases according to the nutrient availability, through which biofilms improve their survivability by effectively utilizing limited resources. While models that can separately simulate intra- and inter- biofilm oscillatory dynamics have been proposed, recapturing these dynamics by a simple phenomenological model remains to be done. Extending from our previous work where we developed a simple reaction-diffusion model that captures the essence of the oscillatory colony growth dynamics of a single biofilm, here we show that a model similar to our previous one can recapitulate the inter- as well as intra-biofilm dynamics.}

By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.}

For a long time, it was believed that recurrent networks are difficult to train using simple optimizers, such as stochastic gradient descent, due to the so-called vanishing gradient problem. In this paper, we show that learning longer term patterns in real data, such as in natural language, is perfectly possible using gradient descent. This is achieved by using a slight structural modification of the simple recurrent neural network architecture. We encourage some of the hidden units to change their state slowly by making part of the recurrent weight matrix close to identity, thus forming kind of a longer term memory. We evaluate our model in language modeling experiments, where we obtain similar performance to the much more complex Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks (Hochreiter \& Schmidhuber, 1997).},

We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis. View synthesis results are best viewed as videos, so we urge readers to view our supplementary video for convincing comparisons.},

  abstract = {Backpropagation of error (backprop) is a powerful algorithm for training machine learning architectures through end-to-end differentiation. Recently it has been shown that backprop in multilayerperceptrons (MLPs) can be approximated using predictive coding, a biologically-plausible process theory of cortical computation which relies solely on local and Hebbian updates. The power of backprop, however, lies not in its instantiation in MLPs, but rather in the concept of automatic differentiation which allows for the optimisation of any differentiable program expressed as a computation graph. Here, we demonstrate that predictive coding converges asymptotically (and in practice rapidly) to exact backprop gradients on arbitrary computation graphs using only local learning rules. We apply this result to develop a straightforward strategy to translate core machine learning architectures into their predictive coding equivalents. We construct predictive coding CNNs, RNNs, and the more complex LSTMs, which include a non-layer-like branching internal graph structure and multiplicative interactions. Our models perform equivalently to backprop on challenging machine learning benchmarks, while utilising only local and (mostly) Hebbian plasticity. Our method raises the potential that standard machine learning algorithms could in principle be directly implemented in neural circuitry, and may also contribute to the development of completely distributed neuromorphic architectures.},

In this paper, we show that a significant number of “negative“ examples generated by the labeling process are false negatives because the knowledge base is incomplete. Therefore the heuristic for generating negative examples has a serious flaw. Building on a state-of-the-art distantly-supervised extraction algorithm, we proposed an algorithm that learns from only positive and unlabeled labels at the pair-of-entity level. Experimental results demonstrate its advantage over existing algorithms.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved great success in many computer vision tasks. Partially inspired by neuroscience, CNN shares many properties with the visual system of the brain. A prominent difference is that CNN is typically a feed-forward architecture while in the visual system recurrent connections are abundant. Inspired by this fact, we propose a recurrent CNN (RCNN) for object recognition by incorporating recurrent connections into each convolutional layer. Though the input is static, the activities of RCNN units evolve over time so that the activity of each unit is modulated by the activities of its neighboring units. This property enhances the ability of the model to integrate the context information, which is important for object recognition. Like other recurrent neural networks, unfolding the RCNN through time can result in an arbitrarily deep network with a fixed number of parameters. Furthermore, the unfolded network has multiple paths, which can facilitate the learning process. The model is tested on four benchmark object recognition datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST and SVHN. With fewer trainable parameters, RCNN outperforms the state-of-the-art models on all of these datasets. Increasing the number of parameters leads to even better performance. These results demonstrate the advantage of the recurrent structure over purely feed-forward structure for object recognition.},

We investigate an alternative paradigm that does not require labeled corpora, avoiding the domain dependence of ACE- style algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora of any size. Our experiments use Freebase, a large semantic database of several thousand relations, to provide distant supervision. For each pair of enti- ties that appears in some Freebase relation, we find all sentences containing those entities in a large un- labeled corpus and extract textual features to train a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines the advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000 noisy pattern features in a probabilistic classifier) and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of relations from large corpora of any domain). Our model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 re- lations at a precision of 67.6\%. We also analyze feature performance, showing that syntactic parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression.}

In particular, we identify four “epochs of innovation” in which new CA strategies for solving the problem are discovered by the GA, describe how these strategies are implemented in CA rule tables, and identify the GA mechanisms underlying their discovery. The epochs are characterized by a breaking of the task's symmetries on the part of the GA. The symmetry breaking results in a short-term fitness gain but ultimately prevents the discovery of the most highly fit strategies. We discuss the extent to which symmetry breaking and other impediments are general phenomena in any GA search.},

Cooperation can be favored when the mobility of individuals allows cooperators to form a cluster (or group). Mobility patterns of animals sometimes follow a Lévy flight. A Lévy flight is a kind of random walk but it is composed of many small movements with a few big movements. Here, we developed an agent-based model in a square lattice where agents perform Lévy flights depending on the fraction of neighboring defectors. We focus on how the sensitivity to defectors when performing Lévy flights promotes the evolution of cooperation. Results of evolutionary simulations showed that cooperation was most promoted when the sensitivity to defectors was moderate. As the population density became larger, higher sensitivity was more beneficial for cooperation to evolve.}

  abstract = {Generalized behavior is a long standing goal for evolutionary robotics. Behaviors for a given task should be robust to perturbation and capable of operating across a variety of environments. We have previously shown that Lexicase selection evolves high-performing individuals in a semi-generalized wall crossing task–i.e., where the task is broadly the same, but there is variation between individual instances. Further work has identified effective parameter values for Lexicase selection in this domain but other factors affecting and explaining performance remain to be identified. In this paper, we expand our prior investigations, examining populations over evolutionary time exploring other factors that might lead to generalized behavior. Results show that genomic clusters do not correspond to performance, indicating that clusters of specialists do not form within the population. While early individuals gain a foothold in the selection process by specializing on a few wall heights, successful populations are ultimately pressured towards generalized behavior. Finally, we find that this transition from specialists to generalists also leads to an increase in tiebreaks, a mechanism in Lexicase, during selection providing a metric to assess the performance of individual replicates.}

  abstract = {Elementary cellular automata (ECA) is a widely studied one-dimensional processing methodology where the successive iteration of the automaton may lead to the recreation of a rich pattern dynamic. Recently, cellular automata have been proposed as a feasible way to implement Reservoir Computing (RC) systems in which the automata rule is fixed and the training is performed using a linear regression. In this work we perform an exhaustive study of the performance of the different ECA rules when applied to pattern recognition of time-independent input signals using a RC scheme. Once the different ECA rules have been tested, the most accurate one (rule 90) is selected to implement a digital circuit. Rule 90 is easily reproduced using a reduced set of XOR gates and shift-registers, thus representing a high-performance alternative for RC hardware implementation in terms of processing time, circuit area, power dissipation and system accuracy. The model (both in software and its hardware implementation) has been tested using a pattern recognition task of handwritten numbers (the MNIST database) for which we obtained competitive results in terms of accuracy, speed and power dissipation. The proposed model can be considered to be a low-cost method to implement fast pattern recognition digital circuits.},

  abstract = {The emergence of new replicating entities from the union of simpler entities characterizes some of the most profound events in natural evolutionary history. Such transitions in individuality are essential to the evolution of the most complex forms of life. Thus, understanding these transitions is critical to building artificial systems capable of open-ended evolution. Alas, these transitions are challenging to induce or detect, even with computational organisms. Here, we introduce the DISHTINY (Distributed Hierarchical Transitions in Individuality) platform, which provides simple cell-like organisms with the ability and incentive to unite into new individuals in a manner that can continue to scale to subsequent transitions. The system is designed to encourage these transitions so that they can be studied: Organisms that coordinate spatiotemporally can maximize the rate of resource harvest, which is closely linked to their reproductive ability. We demonstrate the hierarchical emergence of multiple levels of individuality among simple cell-like organisms that evolve parameters for manually designed strategies. During evolution, we observe reproductive division of labor and close cooperation among cells, including resource-sharing, aggregation of resource endowments for propagules, and emergence of an apoptosis response to somatic mutation. Many replicate populations evolved to direct their resources toward low-level groups (behaving like multicellular individuals), and many others evolved to direct their resources toward high-level groups (acting as larger-scale multicellular individuals).},

  abstract = {Evolutionary robotics (ER) aims at automatically designing robots or controllers of robots without having to describe their inner workings. To reach this goal, ER researchers primarily employ phenotypes that can lead to an infinite number of robot behaviors and fitness functions that only reward the achievement of the task--and not how to achieve it. These choices make ER particularly prone to premature convergence. To tackle this problem, several papers recently proposed to explicitly encourage the diversity of the robot behaviors, rather than the diversity of the genotypes as in classic evolutionary optimization. Such an approach avoids the need to compute distances between structures and the pitfalls of the noninjectivity of the phenotype/behavior relation; however, it also introduces new questions: how to compare behavior? should this comparison be task specific? and what is the best way to encourage diversity in this context? In this paper, we review the main published approaches to behavioral diversity and benchmark them in a common framework. We compare each approach on three different tasks and two different genotypes. The results show that fostering behavioral diversity substantially improves the evolutionary process in the investigated experiments, regardless of genotype or task. Among the benchmarked approaches, multi-objective methods were the most efficient and the generic, Hamming-based, behavioral distance was at least as efficient as task specific behavioral metrics.},

  abstract = {Many fields use search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to find high-performing solutions: chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger, cheaper, safer designs, scientists search for models that best explain data, etc. The goal of search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new, fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites) algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single, high-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of the search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because MAP- Elites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of interest in solutions, (2) returns a set of high-performing, yet diverse solutions, and (3) improves finding a single, best solution, it will advance science and engineering.},

Compared to classic problems in continuous direct search, deep networks pose extremely high-dimensional optimization problems, with many thousands or even millions of variables. In addition, many control problems give rise to a stochastic fitness function. Considering the relevance of the application, we study the suitability of evolution strategies for highdimensional, stochastic problems. Our results give insights into which algorithmic mechanisms of modern ES are of value for the class of problems at hand, and they reveal principled limitations of the approach. They are in line with our theoretical understanding of ESs. We show that combining ESs that offer reduced internal algorithm cost with uncertainty handling techniques yields promising methods for this class of problems.},

The resulting process is extremely reliable in the face of random agent distributions and varying agent numbers. In addition the process is scale-independent, which implies that the pattern scales as the number of agents increases, with no modification of the agent program. The pattern also scales asymmetrically to produce related patterns, such as D’Arcy Thompson’s famous transformations.},

  abstract = {Lifelong learning and adaptability are two defining aspects of biological agents. Modern reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown significant progress in solving complex tasks, however once training is concluded, the found solutions are typically static and incapable of adapting to new information or perturbations. While it is still not completely understood how biological brains learn and adapt so efficiently from experience, it is believed that synaptic plasticity plays a prominent role in this process. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose a search method that, instead of optimizing the weight parameters of neural networks directly, only searches for synapse-specific Hebbian learning rules that allow the network to continuously self-organize its weights during the lifetime of the agent. We demonstrate our approach on several reinforcement learning tasks with different sensory modalities and more than 450K trainable plasticity parameters. We find that starting from completely random weights, the discovered Hebbian rules enable an agent to navigate a dynamical 2D-pixel environment; likewise they allow a simulated 3D quadrupedal robot to learn how to walk while adapting to morphological damage not seen during training and in the absence of any explicit reward or error signal in less than 100 timesteps.

It utilizes the nonlinear interference of history-dependent asymmetrically propagating spin waves excited by the magneto-electric effect. First, we investigate a feasible device structure with practical physical parameters in micromagnetic numerical analysis, and show the detailed characteristics of the forward volume magnetostatic spin waves. Then, we demonstrate high generalization ability in the estimation of input-signal parameters performed by the spin-wave-based reservoir computing. We find that the hysteresis characteristics of the spin waves propagating asymmetrically with respect to excitation points, as well as the nonlinear interference, works advantageously to realize high diversity in the time-sequential signals in high-dimensional information space, which has the highest significance for effective learning in reservoir computing. The spin wave device is highly promising for next-generation machine-learning electronics.},

However, recent empirical results with over-parameterized neural networks are marked by a striking absence of the classic U-shaped test error curve: test error keeps decreasing in wider networks. This suggests that there might not be a bias-variance tradeoff in neural networks with respect to network width, unlike was originally claimed by, e.g., Geman et al. (1992). Motivated by the shaky evidence used to support this claim in neural networks, we measure bias and variance in the modern setting. We find that both bias and variance can decrease as the number of parameters grows. To better understand this, we introduce a new decomposition of the variance to disentangle the effects of optimization and data sampling. We also provide theoretical analysis in a simplified setting that is consistent with our empirical findings.},

Reliance on a global synchronous update signal has been a limitation of all solutions since the problem of achieving self-production in cellular automata was first attacked by Von Neumann half a century ago. Our results obviate the need for this restriction. We introduce a simple constructive mechanism to transform any cellular automata network with synchronous update into one with the same behavior but whose cells may be updated randomly and asynchronously. This is achieved by introduction of a synchronization substratum which locally keeps track of the passage of time in a local neighborhood in a manner that keeps all cells locally in-step. The generality of this mechanism is guaranteed by a general mathematical theorem (due to the author) that allows any synchronous cellular automata configuration and rule to be realized asynchronously in such a way the the behavior of the original synchronous cellular automata can be recovered from that of the corresponding asynchronous cellular automaton. Thus all important results on self-reproduction, universal computation, and universal construction, and evolution in populations of self-reproducing configurations in cellular automata that have been obtained in the past carry over to the asynchronous domain.},

  abstract = {Despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methods— algorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data—there are several unresolved issues. First. there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems.}

However, elements other than head words contain useful information. For instance, an armed man is more discriminative than man. Our model takes into account this information and precisely represents it using probabilistic topic distributions. We illustrate that such information plays an important role in parameter estimation. Mostly, it makes topic distributions more coherent and more discriminative. Experimental results on benchmark dataset empirically confirm this enhancement.},

Such phenotypic structural complexity is the result of morphogenesis, where cells grow and differentiate according to the information encoded in the genome. In this paper we investigate the structural complexity of artificial cellular organisms at phenotypic level, in order to understand if genome information could be used to predict the emergent structural complexity. Our measure of structural complexity is based on the theory of Kolmogorov complexity and approximations. We relate the Lambda parameter, with its ability to detect different behavioral regimes, to the calculated structural complexity. It is shown that the easily computable Lempel-Ziv complexity approximation has a good ability to discriminate emergent structural complexity, thus providing a measurement that can be related to a genome parameter for estimation of the developed organism’s phenotypic complexity.

In this paper the usage of Cellular Automata (CA) as a reservoir is investigated. The use of CA in RC has been showing promising results. In this paper, selected state-of-the-art experiments are reproduced. It is shown that some CA-rules perform better than others, and the reservoir performance is improved by increasing the size of the CA reservoir itself. In addition, the usage of parallel loosely coupled CA-reservoirs, where each reservoir has a different CA-rule, is investigated. The experiments performed on quasi-uniform CA reservoir provide valuable insights in CA reservoir design. The results herein show that some rules do not work well together, while other combinations work remarkably well. This suggests that non-uniform CA could represent a powerful tool for novel CA reservoir implementations.},

In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive datasets. The first is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web. To this end, we also discuss Google's Knowledge Vault project as an example of such combination.},

A cellular space is called fault tolerant if it behaves normally even when its component cells misoperate. First such notions as simulation, misoperation, and K-separated misoperation are defined. Then a new multidimensional coding of configurations is introduced and explained using as typical example the two-dimensional space. The first main result is Theorem 1, which states that the introduced coding method is useful for correcting errors occurring at most once in every K=5×5 rectangle. The general theory is given in Section 6, where the second main result is given in the form of Theorem 8. It gives a necessary and sufficient condition for testing whether or not a given coding is adequate for error correction.},

We present Elementary, a prototype KBC system that is able to combine diverse resources and different KBC techniques via machine learning and statistical inference to construct knowledge bases. Using Elementary, we have implemented a solution to the TAC-KBP challenge with quality comparable to the state of the art, as well as an end-to-end online demonstration that automatically and continuously enriches Wikipedia with structured data by reading millions of webpages on a daily basis. We describe several challenges and our solutions in designing, implementing, and deploying Elementary. In particular, we first describe the conceptual framework and architecture of Elementary, and then discuss how we address scalability challenges to enable Web-scale deployment. First, to take advantage of diverse data resources and proven techniques, Elementary employs Markov logic, a succinct yet expressive language to specify probabilistic graphical models. Elementary accepts both domain-knowledge rules and classical machine-learning models such as conditional random fields, thereby integrating different data resources and KBC techniques in a principled manner. Second, to support large-scale KBC with terabytes of data and millions of entities, Elementary leverages high-throughput parallel computing infrastructure such as Hadoop, Condor, and parallel databases. Furthermore, to scale sophisticated statistical inference, Elementary employs a novel decomposition-based approach to Markov logic inference that solves routine subtasks such as classification and coreference with specialized algorithms. We empirically show that this decomposition-based inference approach achieves higher performance than prior inference approaches. To validate the effectiveness of Elementary's approach to KBC, we experimentally show that its ability to incorporate diverse signals has positive impacts on KBC quality.},

We present Tuffy that achieves scalability via three novel contributions: (1) a bottom-up approach to grounding that allows us to leverage the full power of the relational optimizer, (2) a novel hybrid architecture that allows us to perform AI-style local search efficiently using an RDBMS, and (3) a theoretical insight that shows when one can (exponentially) improve the efficiency of stochastic local search. We leverage (3) to build novel partitioning, loading, and parallel algorithms. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art implementations in both quality and speed on several publicly available datasets.}

Logical aspects concerning the structure and the behavior of simple and complex cellular automata are discussed. The complete description of a universal constructor, i.e., an automaton which, once supplied with a suitable code formed by a cell pencil, is capable of generating any sort of automaton, is also presented for the first time. This generative capability is based on the local injection of a cell-excitation stream into the planar cell lattice. The realization of a universal constructor substantially simpler than those proposed by other authors was possible thanks to the use of a sophisticated graphic and logical environment for the composition of cell assemblies and the observation of their evolution. This research is focused on how cellular automata can be created and used to implement parallel information processing by planar cell lattices. An appealing feature of our approach is the perspective of producing silicon cell automata capable of performing any sort of parallel computation by the temporary generation of suitable cell state configurations. This appears a necessary condition for the effective implementation of general purpose parallel computers as, in general, good performance in parallel processing depends rather critically on architectural optimality relative the task to be performed.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural networks are most commonly trained with the back-propagation algorithm, where the gradient for learning is provided by back-propagating the error, layer by layer, from the output layer to the hidden layers. A recently discovered method called feedback-alignment shows that the weights used for propagating the error backward don't have to be symmetric with the weights used for propagation the activation forward. In fact, random feedback weights work evenly well, because the network learns how to make the feedback useful. In this work, the feedback alignment principle is used for training hidden layers more independently from the rest of the network, and from a zero initial condition. The error is propagated through fixed random feedback connections directly from the output layer to each hidden layer. This simple method is able to achieve zero training error even in convolutional networks and very deep networks, completely without error back-propagation. The method is a step towards biologically plausible machine learning because the error signal is almost local, and no symmetric or reciprocal weights are required. Experiments show that the test performance on MNIST and CIFAR is almost as good as those obtained with back-propagation for fully connected networks. If combined with dropout, the method achieves 1.45\% error on the permutation invariant MNIST task.},

However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to address many issues that these algorithms would face in real-world applications. After creating a unified reimplementation of various widely-used SSL techniques, we test them in a suite of experiments designed to address these issues. We find that the performance of simple baselines which do not use unlabeled data is often underreported, that SSL methods differ in sensitivity to the amount of labeled and unlabeled data, and that performance can degrade substantially when the unlabeled dataset contains out-of-class examples. To help guide SSL research towards real-world applicability, we make our unified reimplemention and evaluation platform publicly available.},

  abstract = {Learning useful information across long time lags is a critical and difficult problem for temporal neural models in tasks such as language modeling. Existing architectures that address the issue are often complex and costly to train. The Differential State Framework (DSF) is a simple and high-performing design that unifies previously introduced gated neural models. DSF models maintain longer-term memory by learning to interpolate between a fast-changing data-driven representation and a slowly changing, implicitly stable state. This requires hardly any more parameters than a classical, simple recurrent network. Within the DSF framework, a new architecture is presented, the Delta-RNN. In language modeling at the word and character levels, the Delta-RNN outperforms popular complex architectures, such as the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and, when regularized, performs comparably to several state-of-the-art baselines. At the subword level, the Delta-RNN's performance is comparable to that of complex gated architectures.},

The two-space algorithm is a particularly efficient algorithm for polymer simulation that is easy to implement and generalize on both conventional serial hardward and Cellular Automaton (CA) Machines. We describe the implementation of this algorithm and two applications: two dimensions (2-D) melts and polymer collapse. Simulations of high density melts in 2-D show that contrary to expectations polymers do not segregate at high density, there is significant interpenetration as there is in 3-D. Polymer collapse is studied in the regime far from equilibrium. Collapse is found to be dominated by migration of the chain ends. The kinetic process of collapse can systematically and reproducibly restrict the possible conformations that are explored during protein folding. This suggests that the kinetics of collapse may help lead to the desired folded conformation of proteins.},

So far, this concept was mostly used to generate images for a single scenario. As each scenario requires a new model, this type of generation seems contradictory to the adaptability of cells in nature. To address this contradiction, we introduce a concept using different initial environments as input while using a single Neural Cellular Automata to produce several outputs. Additionally, we introduce GANCA, a novel algorithm that combines Neural Cellular Automata with Generative Adversarial Networks, allowing for more generalization through adversarial training. The experiments show that a single model is capable of learning several images when presented with different inputs, and that the adversarially trained model improves drastically on out-of-distribution data compared to a supervised trained model.},

It has been argued to be a crucial mechanism for open-ended cognitive development in humans, and as such has gathered a growing interest from developmental roboticists in the recent years. The goal of this paper is threefold. First, it provides a synthesis of the different approaches of intrinsic motivation in psychology. Second, by interpreting these approaches in a computational reinforcement learning framework, we argue that they are not operational and even sometimes inconsistent. Third, we set the ground for a systematic operational study of intrinsic motivation by presenting a formal typology of possible computational approaches. This typology is partly based on existing computational models, but also presents new ways of conceptualizing intrinsic motivation. We argue that this kind of computational typology might be useful for opening new avenues for research both in psychology and developmental robotics.},

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

This article introduces the second of two special issues on current research in OEE and provides an overview of the contents of both special issues. Most of the work was presented at a workshop on open-ended evolution that was held as a part of the 2018 Conference on Artificial Life in Tokyo, and much of it had antecedents in two previous workshops on open-ended evolution at artificial life conferences in Cancun and York. We present a simplified categorization of OEE and summarize progress in the field as represented by the articles in this special issue.},

This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for computational systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic forgetting. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of robust lifelong learning on autonomous agents and robots. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.},

  abstract = {Contemporary sensorimotor learning approaches typically start with an existing complex agent (e.g., a robotic arm), which they learn to control. In contrast, this paper investigates a modular co-evolution strategy: a collection of primitive agents learns to dynamically self-assemble into composite bodies while also learning to coordinate their behavior to control these bodies. Each primitive agent consists of a limb with a motor attached at one end. Limbs may choose to link up to form collectives. When a limb initiates a link-up action and there is another limb nearby, the latter is magnetically connected to the ‘parent’ limb’s motor. This forms a new single agent, which may further link with other agents. In this way, complex morphologies can emerge, controlled by a policy whose architecture is in explicit correspondence with the morphology.

In the actual history of evolution on Earth, however, there are many examples showing that open-endedness is rather a consequence of evolution. We suggest that this view, which we call “evolved open-endedness” (EOE), be incorporated more in the research of open-ended evolution. This view should allow for systematic investigation of more nuanced, more concrete research questions about open-endedness and its relationship with adaptation and sustainability.},

At test time, it can optimize neural networks with unseen parameters for downstream tasks in just one update. We find that our approach successfully generates parameters for a wide range of loss prompts. Moreover, it can sample multimodal parameter solutions and has favorable scaling properties.

In addition, we show that EMDs with thresholded ground distances have many desirable properties. First, they correspond to the way humans perceive distances. Second, they are robust to outlier noise and quantization effects. Third, they are metrics. Finally, experimental results on image retrieval show that thresholding the ground distance of the EMD improves both accuracy and speed.},

Previous work analyzing this scenario is based on the assumption that the tasks are sampled i.i.d. from a task environment or limited to strongly constrained data distributions. Instead we study two scenarios when lifelong learning is possible, even though the observed tasks do not form an i.i.d. sample: first, when they are sampled from the same environment, but possibly with dependencies, and second, when the task environment is allowed to change over time. In the first case we prove a PAC-Bayesian theorem, which can be seen as a direct generalization of the analogous previous result for the i.i.d. case. For the second scenario we propose to learn an inductive bias in form of a transfer procedure. We present a generalization bound and show on a toy example how it can be used to identify a beneficial transfer algorithm.},

In this work, we consider a setting where the learner encounters a stream of tasks but is able to retain only limited information from each encountered task, such as a learned predictor. In contrast to most previous works analyzing this scenario, we do not make any distributional assumptions on the task generating process. Instead, we formulate a complexity measure that captures the diversity of the observed tasks. We provide a lifelong learning algorithm with error guarantees for every observed task (rather than on average). We show sample complexity reductions in comparison to solving every task in isolation in terms of our task complexity measure. Further, our algorithmic framework can naturally be viewed as learning a representation from encountered tasks with a neural network.},

  abstract = {Optimal Transport (OT) is a mathematical gem at the interface between probability, analysis and optimization. The goal of that theory is to define geometric tools that are useful to compare probability distributions. Earlier contributions originated from Monge's work in the 18th century, to be later rediscovered under a different formalism by Tolstoi in the 1920's, Kantorovich, Hitchcock and Koopmans in the 1940's. The problem was solved numerically by Dantzig in 1949 and others in the 1950's within the framework of linear programming, paving the way for major industrial applications in the second half of the 20th century. OT was later rediscovered under a different light by analysts in the 90's, following important work by Brenier and others, as well as in the computer vision/graphics fields under the name of earth mover's distances. Recent years have witnessed yet another revolution in the spread of OT, thanks to the emergence of approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine learning (for regression,classification and density fitting). This short book reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly useful for some of these applications.},

  abstract = {We propose Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a fast and inexpensive approach for automatic model design. In ENAS, a controller learns to discover neural network architectures by searching for an optimal subgraph within a large computational graph. The controller is trained with policy gradient to select a subgraph that maximizes the expected reward on the validation set. Meanwhile the model corresponding to the selected subgraph is trained to minimize a canonical cross entropy loss. Thanks to parameter sharing between child models, ENAS is fast: it delivers strong empirical performances using much fewer GPU-hours than all existing automatic model design approaches, and notably, 1000x less expensive than standard Neural Architecture Search. On the Penn Treebank dataset, ENAS discovers a novel architecture that achieves a test perplexity of 55.8, establishing a new state-of-the-art among all methods without post-training processing. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, ENAS designs novel architectures that achieve a test error of 2.89\%, which is on par with NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018), whose test error is 2.65\%.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks coupled with fast simulation and improved computation have led to recent successes in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). However, most current RL-based approaches fail to generalize since: (a) the gap between simulation and real world is so large that policy-learning approaches fail to transfer; (b) even if policy learning is done in real world, the data scarcity leads to failed generalization from training to test scenarios (e.g., due to different friction or object masses). Inspired from H∞ control methods, we note that both modeling errors and differences in training and test scenarios can be viewed as extra forces/disturbances in the system. This paper proposes the idea of robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), where we train an agent to operate in the presence of a destabilizing adversary that applies disturbance forces to the system. The jointly trained adversary is reinforced – that is, it learns an optimal destabilization policy. We formulate the policy learning as a zero-sum, minimax objective function. Extensive experiments in multiple environments (InvertedPendulum, HalfCheetah, Swimmer, Hopper, Walker2d and Ant) conclusively demonstrate that our method (a) improves training stability; (b) is robust to differences in training/test conditions; and c) outperform the baseline even in the absence of the adversary.},

One method to create probabilities is to directly train a kernel classifier with a logit link function and a regularized maximum likelihood score. However, training with a maximum likelihood score will produce non-sparse kernel machines. Instead, we train an SVM, then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the SVM outputs into probabilities. This chapter compares classification error rate and likelihood scores for an SVM plus sigmoid versus a kernel method trained with a regularized likelihood error function. These methods are tested on three data-mining-style data sets. The SVM+sigmoid yields probabilities of comparable quality to the regularized maximum likelihood kernel method, while still retaining the sparseness of the SVM.},

  abstract = {On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law \& Economics, we conduct an extensive review of papers published in this journal that address the economic dimensions of international environmental agreements (IEAs). We focus particularly on the lessons learnt from this body of literature and the implications for the assessment and design of IEAs in relation to goals such as efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. Our key conclusions run as follows. First, at the international level, universal coalitions are more cost-efficient and effective than fragmented regimes, but more difficult to negotiate and less stable. Second, in developing countries, there is need for substantial external funding to cover the short-run costs of environmental compliance. Third, market-based solutions have been increasingly applied in international agreements but with mixed results. For example, cap-and-trade systems have the potential to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions and least economic cost. But in the provisioning of water services, private sector solutions often result in outcomes that are unaffordable for low-income groups or nonviable for businesses, suggesting well-designed public–private partnerships. At the international level, Green Bond markets can attract investors for climate and environmental projects, but implementation failures tend to weaken outcomes. Finally, in practical politics, economically optimal designs are rarely achieved. Future applied economic research should therefore critically investigate institutions and the scope for their reform. Gains in knowledge are expected to come from economic analyses taking a broader perspective on “the economy”, taking institutions and social and ecological relations into account from the start.},

  abstract = {While evolutionary computation and evolutionary robotics take inspiration from nature, they have long focused mainly on problems of performance optimization. Yet evolution in nature can be interpreted as more nuanced than a process of simple optimization. In particular, natural evolution is a divergent search that optimizes locally within each niche as it simultaneously diversifies. This tendency to discover both quality and diversity at the same time differs from many of the conventional algorithms of machine learning, and also thereby suggests a different foundation for inferring the approach of greatest potential for evolutionary algorithms. In fact, several recent evolutionary algorithms called quality diversity (QD) algorithms(e.g. novelty search with local competition and MAP-Elites) have drawn inspiration from this more nuanced view, aiming to fill a space of possibilities with the best possible example of each type of achievable behavior. The result is a new class of algorithms that return an archive of diverse, high-quality behaviors in a single run. The aim in this paper is to study the application of QD algorithms in challenging environments (in particular complex mazes) to establish their best practices for ambitious domains in the future. In addition to providing insight into cases when QD succeeds and fails, a new approach is investigated that hybridizes multiple views of behaviors (called behavior characterizations) in the same run, which succeeds in overcoming some of the challenges associated with searching for QD with respect to a behavior characterization that is not necessarily sufficient for generating both quality and diversity at the same time.},

  abstract = {Large-scale information processing systems are able to extract massive collections of interrelated facts, but unfortunately transforming these candidate facts into useful knowledge is a formidable challenge. In this paper, we show how uncertain extractions about entities and their relations can be transformed into a knowledge graph. The extractions form an extraction graph and we refer to the task of removing noise, inferring missing information, and determining which candidate facts should be included into a knowledge graph as knowledge graph identification. In order to perform this task, we must reason jointly about candidate facts and their associated extraction confidences, identify coreferent entities, and incorporate ontological constraints. Our proposed approach uses probabilistic soft logic (PSL), a recently introduced probabilistic modeling framework which easily scales to millions of facts. We demonstrate the power of our method on a synthetic Linked Data corpus derived from the MusicBrainz music community and a real-world set of extractions from the NELL project containing over 1M extractions and 70K ontological relations. We show that compared to existing methods, our approach is able to achieve improved AUC and F1 with significantly lower running time.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.},

In this paper, we present an analysis of Transformer-based language model performance across a wide range of model scales -- from models with tens of millions of parameters up to a 280 billion parameter model called Gopher. These models are evaluated on 152 diverse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the majority. Gains from scale are largest in areas such as reading comprehension, fact-checking, and the identification of toxic language, but logical and mathematical reasoning see less benefit. We provide a holistic analysis of the training dataset and model's behaviour, covering the intersection of model scale with bias and toxicity. Finally we discuss the application of language models to AI safety and the mitigation of downstream harms.},

  abstract = {Reservoir computing is a relatively recent computational paradigm that originates from a recurrent neural network and is known for its wide range of implementations using different physical technologies. Large reservoirs are very hard to obtain in conventional computers, as both the computation complexity and memory usage grow quadratically. We propose an optical scheme performing reservoir computing over very large networks potentially being able to host several millions of fully connected photonic nodes thanks to its intrinsic properties of parallelism and scalability. Our experimental studies confirm that, in contrast to conventional computers, the computation time of our optical scheme is only linearly dependent on the number of photonic nodes of the network, which is due to electronic overheads, while the optical part of computation remains fully parallel and independent of the reservoir size. To demonstrate the scalability of our optical scheme, we perform for the first time predictions on large spatiotemporal chaotic datasets obtained from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation using optical reservoirs with up to 50 000 optical nodes. Our results are extremely challenging for conventional von Neumann machines, and they significantly advance the state of the art of unconventional reservoir computing approaches, in general.},

  abstract = {Living neural networks emerge through a process of growth and self-organization that begins with a single cell and results in a brain, an organized and functional computational device. Artificial neural networks, however, rely on human-designed, hand-programmed architectures for their remarkable performance. Can we develop artificial computational devices that can grow and self-organize without human intervention? In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired developmental algorithm that can ‘grow’ a functional, layered neural network from a single initial cell. The algorithm organizes inter-layer connections to construct retinotopic pooling layers. Our approach is inspired by the mechanisms employed by the early visual system to wire the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), days before animals open their eyes. The key ingredients for robust self-organization are an emergent spontaneous spatiotemporal activity wave in the first layer and a local learning rule in the second layer that ‘learns’ the underlying activity pattern in the first layer. The algorithm is adaptable to a wide-range of input-layer geometries, robust to malfunctioning units in the first layer, and so can be used to successfully grow and self-organize pooling architectures of different pool-sizes and shapes. The algorithm provides a primitive procedure for constructing layered neural networks through growth and self-organization. We also demonstrate that networks grown from a single unit perform as well as hand-crafted networks on MNIST. Broadly, our work shows that biologically inspired developmental algorithms can be applied to autonomously grow functional ‘brains’ in-silico.},

Models for systems of cities implementing elementary evolutionary processes remain however to be investigated. We propose here such a model for urban dynamics at the macroscopic scale, in which the diffusion of innovations between cities captures transformation processes (mutations) and transmission processes (diffusion), using two coupled spatial interaction models. Explorations of the model on synthetic systems of cities show the role of spatial interaction and innovation diffusion ranges on measures of diversity and utility, and the existence of intermediate ranges yielding an optimal utility. Multi-objective optimization shows how the model produces a compromize between utility and diversity. This model paves the way towards more elaborated formalizations of urban evolution.},

  abstract = {Coordinate-MLPs are emerging as an effective tool for modeling multidimensional continuous signals, overcoming many drawbacks associated with discrete grid-based approximations. However, coordinate-MLPs with ReLU activations, in their rudimentary form, demonstrate poor performance in representing signals with high fidelity, promoting the need for positional embedding layers. Recently, Sitzmann et al. proposed a sinusoidal activation function that has the capacity to omit positional embedding from coordinate-MLPs while still preserving high signal fidelity. Despite its potential, ReLUs are still dominating the space of coordinate-MLPs; we speculate that this is due to the hyper-sensitivity of networks -- that employ such sinusoidal activations -- to the initialization schemes. In this paper, we attempt to broaden the current understanding of the effect of activations in coordinate-MLPs, and show that there exists a broader class of activations that are suitable for encoding signals. We affirm that sinusoidal activations are only a single example in this class, and propose several non-periodic functions that empirically demonstrate more robust performance against random initializations than sinusoids. Finally, we advocate for a shift towards coordinate-MLPs that employ these non-traditional activation functions due to their high performance and simplicity.},

We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. Moreover, the joint embedding space of CLIP enables language-guided image manipulations in a zero-shot fashion. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.},

This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns is traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal for metastable states, is uniformly distributed for global averaging, and vanishes for a fixed point near a stored pattern. Using the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT models. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging, e.g. our proposed Gaussian weighting. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks with Hopfield networks outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns. We provide a new PyTorch layer called "Hopfield", which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as a new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.

In MPLP, we abstract every operations occurring in ANNs as independent agents. Each agent is responsible for ingesting incoming multidimensional messages from other agents, updating its internal state, and generating multidimensional messages to be passed on to neighbouring agents. We demonstrate the viability of MPLP as opposed to traditional gradient-based approaches on simple feed-forward neural networks, and present a framework capable of generalizing to non-traditional neural network architectures. MPLP is meta learned using end-to-end gradientbased meta-optimisation. We further discuss the observed properties of MPLP and hypothesize its applicability on various fields of deep learning.},

  abstract = {Large labeled training sets are the critical building blocks of supervised learning methods and are key enablers of deep learning techniques. For some applications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and expensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm for the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in which users express weak supervision strategies or domain heuristics as labeling functions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are noisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training set labeling process as a generative model, we can "denoise" the generated training set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of these generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a discriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method over a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs. Experimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that data programming would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying data programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points over a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the competition). Additionally, in initial user studies we observed that data programming may be an easier way for non-experts to create machine learning models when training data is limited or unavailable.},

We present Snorkel, a first-of-its-kind system that enables users to train state-of-the-art models without hand labeling any training data. Instead, users write labeling functions that express arbitrary heuristics, which can have unknown accuracies and correlations. Snorkel denoises their outputs without access to ground truth by incorporating the first end-to-end implementation of our recently proposed machine learning paradigm, data programming. We present a flexible interface layer for writing labeling functions based on our experience over the past year collaborating with companies, agencies, and research labs. In a user study, subject matter experts build models 2.8x faster and increase predictive performance an average 45.5\% versus seven hours of hand labeling. We study the modeling tradeoffs in this new setting and propose an optimizer for automating tradeoff decisions that gives up to 1.8x speedup per pipeline execution. In two collaborations, with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and on four open-source text and image data sets representative of other deployments, Snorkel provides 132\% average improvements to predictive performance over prior heuristic approaches and comes within an average 3.60\% of the predictive performance of large hand-curated training sets.},

Specifically, we employ simple evolutionary techniques at unprecedented scales to discover models for the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, starting from trivial initial conditions and reaching accuracies of 94.6\% (95.6\% for ensemble) and 77.0\%, respectively. To do this, we use novel and intuitive mutation operators that navigate large search spaces; we stress that no human participation is required once evolution starts and that the output is a fully-trained model. Throughout this work, we place special emphasis on the repeatability of results, the variability in the outcomes and the computational requirements.},

Although evolutionary algorithms have been repeatedly applied to neural network topologies, the image classifiers thus discovered have remained inferior to human-crafted ones. Here, we evolve an image classifier---AmoebaNet-A---that surpasses hand-designs for the first time. To do this, we modify the tournament selection evolutionary algorithm by introducing an age property to favor the younger genotypes. Matching size, AmoebaNet-A has comparable accuracy to current state-of-the-art ImageNet models discovered with more complex architecture-search methods. Scaled to larger size, AmoebaNet-A sets a new state-of-the-art 83.9\% / 96.6\% top-5 ImageNet accuracy. In a controlled comparison against a well known reinforcement learning algorithm, we give evidence that evolution can obtain results faster with the same hardware, especially at the earlier stages of the search. This is relevant when fewer compute resources are available. Evolution is, thus, a simple method to effectively discover high-quality architectures.},

  abstract = {Knowledge base construction (KBC) is the process of populating a knowledge base, i.e., a relational database together with inference rules, with information extracted from documents and structured sources. KBC blurs the distinction between two traditional database problems, information extraction and information integration. For the last several years, our group has been building knowledge bases with scientific collaborators. Using our approach, we have built knowledge bases that have comparable and sometimes better quality than those constructed by human volunteers. In contrast to these knowledge bases, which took experts a decade or more human years to construct, many of our projects are constructed by a single graduate student. Our approach to KBC is based on joint probabilistic inference and learning, but we do not see inference as either a panacea or a magic bullet: inference is a tool that allows us to be systematic in how we construct, debug, and improve the quality of such systems. In addition, inference allows us to construct these systems in a more loosely coupled way than traditional approaches. To support this idea, we have built the DeepDive system, which has the design goal of letting the user "think about features—not algorithms." We think of DeepDive as declarative in that one specifies what they want but not how to get it. We describe our approach with a focus on feature engineering, which we argue is an understudied problem relative to its importance to end-to-end quality.}

  abstract = {In many complex dynamical systems, artificial or natural, one can observe selforganization of patterns emerging from local rules. Cellular automata, like the Game of Life (GOL), have been widely used as abstract models enabling the study of various aspects of self-organization and morphogenesis, such as the emergence of spatially localized patterns. However, findings of self-organized patterns in such models have so far relied on manual tuning of parameters and initial states, and on the human eye to identify “interesting” patterns. In this paper, we formulate the problem of automated discovery of diverse self-organized patterns in such high-dimensional complex dynamical systems, as well as a framework for experimentation and evaluation. Using a continuous GOL as a testbed, we show that recent intrinsically-motivated machine learning algorithms (POP-IMGEPs), initially developed for learning of inverse models in robotics, can be transposed and used in this novel application area. These algorithms combine intrinsicallymotivated goal exploration and unsupervised learning of goal space representations. Goal space representations describe the “interesting” features of patterns for which diverse variations should be discovered. In particular, we compare various approaches to define and learn goal space representations from the perspective of discovering diverse spatially localized patterns. Moreover, we introduce an extension of a state-of-the-art POP-IMGEP algorithm which incrementally learns a goal representation using a deep auto-encoder, and the use of CPPN primitives for generating initialization parameters. We show that it is more efficient than several baselines and equally efficient as a system pre-trained on a hand-made database of patterns identified by human experts.},

Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary evaluation of four distantly supervised extraction models which assign named entity mentions in text to entries in the event template.

Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efficiently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure.

  abstract = {Unsupervised image-to-image translation is an inherently ill-posed problem. Recent methods based on deep encoder-decoder architectures have shown impressive results, but we show that they only succeed due to a strong locality bias, and they fail to learn very simple nonlocal transformations (e.g. mapping upside down faces to upright faces). When the locality bias is removed, the methods are too powerful and may fail to learn simple local transformations. In this paper we introduce linear encoder-decoder architectures for unsupervised image to image translation. We show that learning is much easier and faster with these architectures and yet the results are surprisingly effective. In particular, we show a number of local problems for which the results of the linear methods are comparable to those of state-of-the-art architectures but with a fraction of the training time, and a number of nonlocal problems for which the state-ofthe-art fails while linear methods succeed.},

  abstract = {In the field of artificial intelligence, a combination of scale in data and model capacity enabled by unsupervised learning has led to major advances in representation learning and statistical generation. In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.},

The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.},

  abstract = {Coherent structures form spontaneously in nonlinear spatiotemporal systems and are found at all spatial scales in natural phenomena from laboratory hydrodynamic flows and chemical reactions to ocean, atmosphere, and planetary climate dynamics. Phenomenologically, they appear as key components that organize the macroscopic behaviors in such systems. Despite a century of effort, they have eluded rigorous analysis and empirical prediction, with progress being made only recently. As a step in this, we present a formal theory of coherent structures in fully-discrete dynamical field theories. It builds on the notion of structure introduced by computational mechanics, generalizing it to a local spatiotemporal setting. The analysis' main tool employs the \textbackslash localstates, which are used to uncover a system's hidden spatiotemporal symmetries and which identify coherent structures as spatially-localized deviations from those symmetries. The approach is behavior-driven in the sense that it does not rely on directly analyzing spatiotemporal equations of motion, rather it considers only the spatiotemporal fields a system generates. As such, it offers an unsupervised approach to discover and describe coherent structures. We illustrate the approach by analyzing coherent structures generated by elementary cellular automata, comparing the results with an earlier, dynamic-invariant-set approach that decomposes fields into domains, particles, and particle interactions.},

However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation.

We identify neural activity and connection patterns that realize a) a representation of the entity to count that was invariant to the task, b) a mapping from entity to number-word, and c) a representation of the number of entities that have been counted that was shared between tasks. The results support the notion that abstract representations of number can arise from integrating experiences across a range of number-related tasks.}

Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model. Imagen achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the COCO dataset, without ever training on COCO, and human raters find Imagen samples to be on par with the COCO data itself in image-text alignment. To assess text-to-image models in greater depth, we introduce DrawBench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for text-to-image models. With DrawBench, we compare Imagen with recent methods including VQ-GAN+CLIP, Latent Diffusion Models, and DALL-E 2, and find that human raters prefer Imagen over other models in side-by-side comparisons, both in terms of sample quality and image-text alignment.

While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40\%, while retaining 97\% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60\% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.},

The main concerns and challenges in the science of complex systems in the context of FuturICT are laid out in this paper with special emphasis on the Complex Systems route to Social Sciences. This include complex systems having: many heterogeneous interacting parts; multiple scales; complicated transition laws; unexpected or unpredicted emergence; sensitive dependence on initial conditions; path-dependent dynamics; networked hierarchical connectivities; interaction of autonomous agents; self-organisation; non-equilibrium dynamics; combinatorial explosion; adaptivity to changing environments; co-evolving subsystems; ill-defined boundaries; and multilevel dynamics. In this context, science is seen as the process of abstracting the dynamics of systems from data. This presents many challenges including: data gathering by large-scale experiment, participatory sensing and social computation, managing huge distributed dynamic and heterogeneous databases; moving from data to dynamical models, going beyond correlations to cause-effect relationships, understanding the relationship between simple and comprehensive models with appropriate choices of variables, ensemble modeling and data assimilation, modeling systems of systems of systems with many levels between micro and macro; and formulating new approaches to prediction, forecasting, and risk, especially in systems that can reflect on and change their behaviour in response to predictions, and systems whose apparently predictable behaviour is disrupted by apparently unpredictable rare or extreme events. These challenges are part of the FuturICT agenda.},

  abstract = {Open-ended evolution requires unbounded possibilities that evolving entities can explore. The cardinality of a set of those possibilities thus has a significant implication for the open-endedness of evolution. I propose that facilitating formation of higher-order entities is a generalizable, effective way to cause a cardinality leap in the set of possibilities that promotes open-endedness. I demonstrate this idea with a simple, proof-of-concept toy model called Hash Chemistry that uses a hash function as a fitness evaluator of evolving entities of any size or order. Simulation results showed that the cumulative number of unique replicating entities that appeared in evolution increased almost linearly along time without an apparent bound, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed cardinality leap. It was also observed that the number of individual entities involved in a single replication event gradually increased over time, indicating evolutionary appearance of higher-order entities. Moreover, these behaviors were not observed in control experiments in which fitness evaluators were replaced by random number generators. This strongly suggests that the dynamics observed in Hash Chemistry were indeed evolutionary behaviors driven by selection and adaptation taking place at multiple scales.},

The principal role of this improvement is to enhance the adaptability (a degree of the variety of situations in which structures in the CA space can operate regularly) of the self-reproductive mechanism of loops. The experiment with evoloop met with the intriguing result that, though no mechanism was explicitly provided to promote evolution, the loops varied through direct interaction of their phenotypes, smaller individuals were naturally selected thanks to their quicker self-reproductive ability, and the whole population gradually evolved toward the smallest ones. This result gives a unique example of evolution of self-replicators where genotypical variation is caused by precedent phenotypical variation. Such interrelation of genotype and phenotype would be one of the important factors driving the evolutionary process of primitive life forms that might have actually occurred in ancient times.},

  abstract = {Self-structuring patterns can be observed all over the universe, from galaxies to molecules to living matter, yet their emergence is waiting for full understanding. We discovered a simple motion law for moving and interacting self-propelled particles leading to a self-structuring, self-reproducing and self-sustaining life-like system. The patterns emerging within this system resemble patterns found in living organisms. The emergent cells we found show a distinct life cycle and even create their own ecosystem from scratch. These structures grow and reproduce on their own, show self-driven behavior and interact with each other. Here we analyze the macroscopic properties of the emerging ecology, as well as the microscopic properties of the mechanism that leads to it. Basic properties of the emerging structures (size distributions, longevity) are analyzed as well as their resilience against sensor or actuation noise. Finally, we explore parameter space for potential other candidates of life. The generality and simplicity of the motion law provokes the thought that one fundamental rule, described by one simple equation yields various structures in nature: it may work on different time- and size scales, ranging from the self-structuring universe, to emergence of living beings, down to the emergent subatomic formation of matter.},

Instead of using the unknown μ(x) he predicts using the celebrated universal enumerable prior M(x) which for all x exceeds any recursive μ(x), save for a constant factor independent of x. The simplicity measure M(x) naturally implements “Occam’s razor” and is closely related to the Kolmogorov complexity of x. However, M assigns high probability to certain data x that are extremely hard to compute. This does not match our intuitive notion of simplicity. Here we suggest a more plausible measure derived from the fastest way of computing data. In absence of contrarian evidence, we assume that the physical world is generated by a computational process, and that any possibly infinite sequence of observations is therefore computable in the limit (this assumption is more radical and stronger than Solomonoff’s). Then we replace M by the novel Speed Prior S, under which the cumulative a priori probability of all data whose computation through an optimal algorithm requires more than O(n) resources is 1/n. We show that the Speed Prior allows for deriving a computable strategy for optimal prediction of future y, given past x. Then we consider the case that the data actually stem from a nonoptimal, unknown computational process, and use Hutter’s recent results to derive excellent expected loss bounds for S-based inductive inference. We conclude with several nontraditional predictions concerning the future of our universe.},

Sometimes, however, gradient information is of little use for training RNNs, due to numerous local minima. For such cases, we present a novel method: EVOlution of systems with LINear Outputs (Evolino). Evolino evolves weights to the nonlinear, hidden nodes of RNNs while computing optimal linear mappings from hidden state to output, using methods such as pseudo-inverse-based linear regression. If we instead use quadratic programming to maximize the margin, we obtain the first evolutionary recurrent support vector machines. We show that Evolino-based LSTM can solve tasks that Echo State nets (Jaeger, 2004a) cannot and achieves higher accuracy in certain continuous function generation tasks than conventional gradient descent RNNs, including gradient-based LSTM.},

Like stochastic gradient (SG) methods, the SAG method's iteration cost is independent of the number of terms in the sum. However, by incorporating a memory of previous gradient values the SAG method achieves a faster convergence rate than black-box SG methods. The convergence rate is improved from O(1/k\^\{1/2\}) to O(1/k) in general, and when the sum is strongly-convex the convergence rate is improved from the sub-linear O(1/k) to a linear convergence rate of the form O(p\^k) for p \textbackslash textless\{\} 1. Further, in many cases the convergence rate of the new method is also faster than black-box deterministic gradient methods, in terms of the number of gradient evaluations. Numerical experiments indicate that the new algorithm often dramatically outperforms existing SG and deterministic gradient methods, and that the performance may be further improved through the use of non-uniform sampling strategies.},

Estimating the gradient of this loss function, using samples, lies at the core of gradient-based learning algorithms for these problems. We introduce the formalism of stochastic computation graphs—directed acyclic graphs that include both deterministic functions and conditional probability distributions—and describe how to easily and automatically derive an unbiased estimator of the loss function’s gradient. The resulting algorithm for computing the gradient estimator is a simple modification of the standard backpropagation algorithm. The generic scheme we propose unifies estimators derived in variety of prior work, along with variance-reduction techniques therein. It could assist researchers in developing intricate models involving a combination of stochastic and deterministic operations, enabling, for example, attention, memory, and control actions.},

First, we propose the use of mini-batch optimization for k-means clustering. This reduces computation cost by orders of magnitude compared to the classic batch algorithm while yielding significantly better solutions than online stochastic gradient descent. Second, we achieve sparsity with projected gradient descent, and give a fast ε-accurate projection onto the L1-ball. Source code is freely available: http://code.google.com/p/sofia-ml},

It is possible that a collaborative process combining feedback from multiple users can improve the quality and quantity of generated artifacts. Picbreeder, a large-scale online experiment in collaborative interactive evolution (CIE), explores this potential. Picbreeder is an online community in which users can evolve and share images, and most importantly, continue evolving others' images. Through this process of branching from other images, and through continually increasing image complexity made possible by the underlying neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) algorithm, evolved images proliferate unlike in any other current IEC system. This paper discusses not only the strengths of the Picbreeder approach, but its challenges and shortcomings as well, in the hope that lessons learned will inform the design of future CIE systems.},

First, we learn an optimal transport (OT) plan, which can be thought as a one-to-many map between the two distributions. To that end, we propose a stochastic dual approach of regularized OT, and show empirically that it scales better than a recent related approach when the amount of samples is very large. Second, we estimate a \textbackslash textit\{Monge map\} as a deep neural network learned by approximating the barycentric projection of the previously-obtained OT plan. This parameterization allows generalization of the mapping outside the support of the input measure. We prove two theoretical stability results of regularized OT which show that our estimations converge to the OT plan and Monge map between the underlying continuous measures. We showcase our proposed approach on two applications: domain adaptation and generative modeling.},

Uniform cellular automata rules are constructed to filter impulse noise from both binary and gray scale images. Several modifications to the standard CA formulation are then applied to improve the filtering performance. For example, a random CA rule solves the noise propagation present in deterministic CA filters. A mirrored CA is used to solve the fixed boundary problem. The performance of this CA approach is compared with the classical median filter and different switching filters in terms of peak signal to noise ratio. This comparison shows that a filter based on cellular automata provides significant improvements over the standard filtering methods.},

  abstract = {The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, most fundamentally the Resource Description Framework (RDF). According to the W3C, "The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries". The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content, information applications and systems. The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data (or data web) that can be processed by machines—that is, one in which much of the meaning is machine-readable. While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept. Berners-Lee originally expressed his vision of the Semantic Web as follows: I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A "Semantic Web", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The "intelligent agents" people have touted for ages will finally materialize. The 2001 Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: "This simple idea…remains largely unrealized". In 2013, more than four million Web domains contained Semantic Web markup.},

We precisely define this complexity for spatially-extended dynamical systems, using the probabilistic ideas of mutual information and minimal sufficient statistics. This leads to a general method for predicting such systems, and a simple algorithm for estimating statistical complexity. The results of applying this algorithm to a class of models of excitable media (cyclic cellular automata) strongly support our proposal.},

  abstract = {Digital simulation enables a wide variety of research and applications underlying the study of artificial life. In evolutionary robotics applications, the focus is often on maximizing performance of an animat for a specific task. Analyzing evolved behaviors can be challenging, however, given the complex coupling of morphology and brain. In this paper, we introduce a simulation environment built to investigate animats capable of smoothly transitioning between operating modes (e.g., from cautious to aggressive or from one physical form to another). The simulator provides functionality for logging sensory information as well as animat state enabling a deep analysis. Although more abstract than soft-body or rigid-body physics engines, it is lightweight and efficient, allowing for a high number of simulations in a small amount of time. The simulation supplements other more complex physics-based environments providing for greater inspection of sensor information and animat behavior. Furthermore, it is designed to provide an extensible test bed beyond just gait transitions to assess new artificial intelligence and evolutionary algorithms and more importantly the combination of these techniques.}

When a larger constituent ends, all of the smaller constituents that are nested within it must also be closed. While the standard LSTM architecture allows different neurons to track information at different time scales, it does not have an explicit bias towards modeling a hierarchy of constituents. This paper proposes to add such an inductive bias by ordering the neurons; a vector of master input and forget gates ensures that when a given neuron is updated, all the neurons that follow it in the ordering are also updated. Our novel recurrent architecture, ordered neurons LSTM (ON-LSTM), achieves good performance on four different tasks: language modeling, unsupervised parsing, targeted syntactic evaluation, and logical inference1.},

By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem.

  abstract = {Recent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76\% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30\% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5\% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2\%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9\% compared to SOTA accuracy of 89.4\%).},

We show that, when using SeeKeR as a dialogue model, it outperforms the state-of-the-art model BlenderBot 2 (Chen et al., 2021) on open-domain knowledge-grounded conversations for the same number of parameters, in terms of consistency, knowledge and per-turn engagingness. SeeKeR applied to topical prompt completions as a standard language model outperforms GPT2 (Radford et al., 2019) and GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020) in terms of factuality and topicality, despite GPT3 being a vastly larger model. Our code and models are made publicly available.},

However, finding Class IV rules is far from straightforward, and can require extensive, time-consuming searches. This work presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that was trained on visual examples of CA behaviour, and learned to classify CA images with a high degree of accuracy. I propose that a refinement of this system could serve as a useful aid to CA research, automatically identifying possible candidates for Class IV behaviour and universality, and significantly reducing the time required to find interesting CA rules.},

The morphologies of creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both generated automatically using genetic algorithms. Different fitness evaluation functions are used to direct simulated evolutions towards specific behaviors such as swimming, walking, jumping, and following. A genetic language is presented that uses nodes and connections as its primitive elements to represent directed graphs, which are used to describe both the morphology and the neural circuitry of these creatures. This genetic language defines a hyperspace containing an indefinite number of possible creatures with behaviors, and when it is searched using optimization techniques, a variety of successful and interesting locomotion strategies emerge, some of which would be difficult to invent or built by design.},

  abstract = {A major impediment of cellular automata (CA) stems from the difficulty of utilizing their complex behavior to perform useful computations. Recent studies by Packard and Mitchell et al. have shown that CAs can be evolved to perform a computational task. In this paper non-uniform CAs are studied, where each cell may contain a different rule, in contrast to the original, uniform model. We describe experiments in which non-uniform CAs are evolved to perform the computational task using a local, co-evolutionary algorithm. For radius r = 3 we attain peak performance values of 0.92 comparable to those obtained for uniform CAs (0.93–0.95). This is notable considering the huge search spaces involved, much larger than the uniform case. Smaller radius CAs (previously unstudied in this context) attain performance values of 0.93–0.94. For r = 1 this is considerably higher than the maximal possible uniform CA performance of 0.83, suggesting that non-uniformity reduces connectivity requirements. We thus demonstrate that: (1) non-uniform CAs can attain high computational performance, and (2) such systems can be evolved rather than designed.},

However, current network architectures for such implicit neural representations are incapable of modeling signals with fine detail, and fail to represent a signal’s spatial and temporal derivatives, despite the fact that these are essential to many physical signals defined implicitly as the solution to partial differential equations. We propose to leverage periodic activation functions for implicit neural representations and demonstrate that these networks, dubbed sinusoidal representation networks or SIRENs, are ideally suited for representing complex natural signals and their derivatives. We analyze SIREN activation statistics to propose a principled initialization scheme and demonstrate the representation of images, wavefields, video, sound, and their derivatives. Further, we show how SIRENs can be leveraged to solve challenging boundary value problems, such as particular Eikonal equations (yielding signed distance functions), the Poisson equation, and the Helmholtz and wave equations. Lastly, we combine SIRENs with hypernetworks to learn priors over the space of SIREN functions. Please see the project website for a video overview of the proposed method and all applications.},

Extensive experiments on the one-step prediction task on well-known benchmark problems show that OESGP produced statistically superior results to current online ESNs and state-of-the-art regression methods. In addition, we characterise the benefits (and drawbacks) associated with the considered online methods, specifically with regards to the trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. For a high-dimensional action recognition task, we demonstrate that OESGP produces high accuracies comparable to a recently published graphical model, while being fast enough for real-time interactive scenarios.},

We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.},

The method is an alternative to the traditional lossless compression algorithms, which it may complement, the two being serviceable for different string lengths. We provide a thorough analysis for all binary strings of length and for most strings of length by running all Turing machines with 5 states and 2 symbols ( with reduction techniques) using the most standard formalism of Turing machines, used in for example the Busy Beaver problem. We address the question of stability and error estimation, the sensitivity of the continued application of the method for wider coverage and better accuracy, and provide statistical evidence suggesting robustness. As with compression algorithms, this work promises to deliver a range of applications, and to provide insight into the question of complexity calculation of finite (and short) strings.

While artificial life worlds have been proposed to study such dynamics and tests have been devised to try to detect them, no theory yet has enumerated the key conditions that are essential to inducing them. The aim of this paper is to further such an understanding by hypothesizing four conditions that are essential for open-ended evolution to prosper. Of course, any such conditions must be satisfied by nature (the clearest example of an open-ended domain), but we do not know the scope or range of possible worlds that could achieve similarly impressive results. To complement the hypothesized conditions, a new artificial life world called Chromaria is introduced that is designed explicitly for testing them. Chromaria, which is intended to deviate from Earth in key respects that highlight the breadth of possible worlds that can satisfy the four conditions, is shown in this paper to stagnate when one of the four conditions is not met. This initial controlled experiment thereby sets the stage for a broad research program and conversation on investigating and controlling for the key conditions for open-ended evolution.},

  abstract = {Feedforward neural networks provide the dominant model of how the brain performs visual object recognition. However, these networks lack the lateral and feedback connections, and the resulting recurrent neuronal dynamics, of the ventral visual pathway in the human and nonhuman primate brain. Here we investigate recurrent convolutional neural networks with bottom-up (B), lateral (L), and top-down (T) connections. Combining these types of connections yields four architectures (B, BT, BL, and BLT), which we systematically test and compare. We hypothesized that recurrent dynamics might improve recognition performance in the challenging scenario of partial occlusion. We introduce two novel occluded object recognition tasks to test the efficacy of the models, \textbackslash emph\{digit clutter\} (where multiple target digits occlude one another) and \textbackslash emph\{digit debris\} (where target digits are occluded by digit fragments). We find that recurrent neural networks outperform feedforward control models (approximately matched in parametric complexity) at recognising objects, both in the absence of occlusion and in all occlusion conditions. Recurrent networks were also found to be more robust to the inclusion of additive Gaussian noise. Recurrent neural networks are better in two respects: (1) they are more neurobiologically realistic than their feedforward counterparts; (2) they are better in terms of their ability to recognise objects, especially under challenging conditions.

  abstract = {Efforts to improve the learning abilities of neural networks have focused mostly on the role of optimization methods rather than on weight initializations. Recent findings, however, suggest that neural networks rely on lucky random initial weights of subnetworks called “lottery tickets” that converge quickly to a solution [8]. To investigate how weight initializations affect performance, we examine small convolutional networks that are trained to predict n steps of the two-dimensional cellular automaton Conway’s Game of Life [3], the update rules of which can be implemented efficiently in a 2n + 1 layer convolutional network. We find that networks of this architecture trained on this task rarely converge. Rather, networks require substantially more parameters to consistently converge. In addition, nearminimal architectures are sensitive to tiny changes in parameters: changing the sign of a single weight can cause the network to fail to learn. Finally, we observe a critical value d0 such that training minimal networks with examples in which cells are alive with probability d0 dramatically increases the chance of convergence to a solution. We conclude that training convolutional neural networks to learn the input/output function represented by n steps of Game of Life exhibits many characteristics predicted by the lottery ticket hypothesis [8], namely, that the size of the networks required to learn this function are often significantly larger than the minimal network required to implement the function.},

However, network training becomes more difficult with increasing depth and training of very deep networks remains an open problem. In this extended abstract, we introduce a new architecture designed to ease gradient-based training of very deep networks. We refer to networks with this architecture as highway networks, since they allow unimpeded information flow across several layers on "information highways". The architecture is characterized by the use of gating units which learn to regulate the flow of information through a network. Highway networks with hundreds of layers can be trained directly using stochastic gradient descent and with a variety of activation functions, opening up the possibility of studying extremely deep and efficient architectures.},

  abstract = {Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings, i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed.},

  abstract = {An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) that outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

  abstract = {Research in neuroevolution, i.e. evolving artificial neural networks (ANNs) through evolutionary algorithms, is inspired by the evolution of biological brains. Because natural evolution discovered intelligent brains with billions of neurons and trillions of connections, perhaps neuroevolution can do the same. Yet while neuroevolution has produced successful results in a variety of domains, the scale of natural brains remains far beyond reach. This paper presents a method called Hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT) that aims to narrow this gap. HyperNEAT employs an indirect encoding called connective Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (connective CPPNs) that can produce connectivity patterns with symmetries and repeating motifs by interpreting spatial patterns generated within a hypercube as connectivity patterns in a lower-dimensional space. The advantage of this approach is that it can exploit the geometry of the task by mapping its regularities onto the topology of the network, thereby shifting problem difficulty away from dimensionality to underlying problem structure. Furthermore, connective CPPNs can represent the same connectivity pattern at any resolution, allowing ANNs to scale to new numbers of inputs and outputs without further evolution. HyperNEAT is demonstrated through visual discrimination and food gathering tasks, including successful visual discrimination networks containing over eight million connections. The main conclusion is that the ability to explore the space of regular connectivity patterns opens up a new class of complex high-dimensional tasks to neuroevolution.},

In this paradigm, the system is not initially designed to accomplish a task, but physically adapts to applied forces to develop the ability to perform the task. Crucially, we require coupled learning to be facilitated by physically plausible learning rules, meaning that learning requires only local responses and no explicit information about the desired functionality. We show that such local learning rules can be derived for any physical network, whether in equilibrium or in steady state, with specific focus on two particular systems, namely disordered flow networks and elastic networks. By applying and adapting advances of statistical learning theory to the physical world, we demonstrate the plausibility of new classes of smart metamaterials capable of adapting to users’ needs in situ.},

In this work, we propose an extension of NCAs to 3D, utilizing 3D convolutions in the proposed neural network architecture. Minecraft is selected as the environment for our automaton since it allows the generation of both static structures and moving machines. We show that despite their simplicity, NCAs are capable of growing complex entities such as castles, apartment blocks, and trees, some of which are composed of over 3,000 blocks. Additionally, when trained for regeneration, the system is able to regrow parts of simple functional machines, significantly expanding the capabilities of simulated morphogenetic systems.

Agents can communicate and can take advantage of being communicated other agents’ plan: therefore they may develop more profitable strategies. We wonder if some kind of collective behaviour, with respect to communication, emerges in this system without being explicitly promoted. To investigate this aspect, we design three different scenarios, respectively a cooperative, a competitive, and a mixed one, in which agents’ behaviors are individually learned by means of reinforcement learning. We consider different strategies concerning communication and learning, including no-communication, always-communication, and optional-communication. Experimental results show that always-communication leads to a collective behaviour with the best results in terms of both overall earned resources and equality between agents. On the other hand optional-communication strategy leads to similar collective strategies in some of these scenarios, but in other scenarios some agents develop individual behaviours that oppose to the collective welfare and thus result in high inequality.},

  abstract = {Reservoir computing is a computational framework suited for temporal/sequential data processing. It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop next-generation machine learning systems.},

These results shed light on recent advances in computer vision and graphics that achieve state-of-the-art results by using MLPs to represent complex 3D objects and scenes. Using tools from the neural tangent kernel (NTK) literature, we show that a standard MLP fails to learn high frequencies both in theory and in practice. To overcome this spectral bias, we use a Fourier feature mapping to transform the effective NTK into a stationary kernel with a tunable bandwidth. We suggest an approach for selecting problem-specific Fourier features that greatly improves the performance of MLPs for low-dimensional regression tasks relevant to the computer vision and graphics communities.},

However, optimizing a coordinate-based network from randomly initialized weights for each new signal is inefficient. We propose applying standard meta-learning algorithms to learn the initial weight parameters for these fully-connected networks based on the underlying class of signals being represented (e.g., images of faces or 3D models of chairs). Despite requiring only a minor change in implementation, using these learned initial weights enables faster convergence during optimization and can serve as a strong prior over the signal class being modeled, resulting in better generalization when only partial observations of a given signal are available. We explore these benefits across a variety of tasks, including representing 2D images, reconstructing CT scans, and recovering 3D shapes and scenes from 2D image observations.},

The discussion emphasizes that it is necessary to consider not just the design of individuals, but also the sort of environment in which they live, and how individuals can interact with each other and with the physical (i.e., abiotic) environment. Much of this discussion is presented in relation to a hypothetical structure that would be suitable for acting as a robust initial seed for an open-ended, creative evolutionary process. The chapter also discusses how these issues should be integrated into a unifying framework in which the study of creative artificial evolutionary systems can be developed.

We briefly summarize the content of the workshop's talks, and identify the main themes that emerged from the open discussions. Two important conclusions from the discussions are: (1) the idea of pluralism about OEE—it seems clear that there is more than one interesting and important kind of OEE; and (2) the importance of distinguishing observable behavioral hallmarks of systems undergoing OEE from hypothesized underlying mechanisms that explain why a system exhibits those hallmarks. We summarize the different hallmarks and mechanisms discussed during the workshop, and list the specific systems that were highlighted with respect to particular hallmarks and mechanisms. We conclude by identifying some of the most important open research questions about OEE that are apparent in light of the discussions. The York workshop provides a foundation for a follow-up OEE2 workshop taking place at the ALIFE XV conference in Cancún, Mexico, in July 2016.

We study variations in how documents and their identifiers are represented, variations in training procedures, and the interplay between models and corpus sizes. Experiments demonstrate that given appropriate design choices, DSI significantly outperforms strong baselines such as dual encoder models. Moreover, DSI demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, outperforming a BM25 baseline in a zero-shot setup.},

If it is possible to discover such attributes, they would be useful in situations where a biometric system fails to identify an individual that has not been enrolled, yet still needs to be identified. The iris was selected as the biometric to analyze for two major reasons: (1) quality methods have already been developed to segment and encode an iris image, (2) current iris encoding methods are conducive to selecting and extracting attributes from an iris texture and creating a meaningful feature vector.},

LaMDA is a family of Transformer-based neural language models specialized for dialog, which have up to 137B parameters and are pre-trained on 1.56T words of public dialog data and web text. While model scaling alone can improve quality, it shows less improvements on safety and factual grounding. We demonstrate that fine-tuning with annotated data and enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources can lead to significant improvements towards the two key challenges of safety and factual grounding. The first challenge, safety, involves ensuring that the model's responses are consistent with a set of human values, such as preventing harmful suggestions and unfair bias. We quantify safety using a metric based on an illustrative set of human values, and we find that filtering candidate responses using a LaMDA classifier fine-tuned with a small amount of crowdworker-annotated data offers a promising approach to improving model safety. The second challenge, factual grounding, involves enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources, such as an information retrieval system, a language translator, and a calculator. We quantify factuality using a groundedness metric, and we find that our approach enables the model to generate responses grounded in known sources, rather than responses that merely sound plausible. Finally, we explore the use of LaMDA in the domains of education and content recommendations, and analyze their helpfulness and role consistency.},

  abstract = {Here we deconstruct, and then in a reasoned way reconstruct, the concept of "entropy of a system," paying particular attention to where the randomness may be coming from. We start with the core concept of entropy as a COUNT associated with a DESCRIPTION; this count (traditionally expressed in logarithmic form for a number of good reasons) is in essence the number of possibilities---specific instances or "scenarios," that MATCH that description. Very natural (and virtually inescapable) generalizations of the idea of description are the probability distribution and of its quantum mechanical counterpart, the density operator. We track the process of dynamically updating entropy as a system evolves. Three factors may cause entropy to change: (1) the system's INTERNAL DYNAMICS; (2) unsolicited EXTERNAL INFLUENCES on it; and (3) the approximations one has to make when one tries to predict the system's future state. The latter task is usually hampered by hard-to-quantify aspects of the original description, limited data storage and processing resource, and possibly algorithmic inadequacy. Factors 2 and 3 introduce randomness into one's predictions and accordingly degrade them. When forecasting, as long as the entropy bookkeping is conducted in an HONEST fashion, this degradation will ALWAYS lead to an entropy increase. To clarify the above point we introduce the notion of HONEST ENTROPY, which coalesces much of what is of course already done, often tacitly, in responsible entropy-bookkeping practice. This notion, we believe, will help to fill an expressivity gap in scientific discourse. With its help we shall prove that ANY dynamical system---not just our physical universe---strictly obeys Clausius's original formulation of the second law of thermodynamics IF AND ONLY IF it is invertible. Thus this law is a TAUTOLOGICAL PROPERTY of invertible systems!},

Although reservoir computing has been mainly applied to time series prediction and recognition, it can be applied to image recognition as well by considering an image data as a sequence of pixel values. However, to achieve a high performance in image recognition with raw image data, a large-scale reservoir including a large number of neurons is required. This is a bottleneck in terms of computer memory and computational cost. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a new method which combines reservoir computing with untrained convolutional neural networks. We use an untrained convolutional neural network to transform raw image data into a set of smaller feature maps in a preprocessing step of the reservoir computing. We demonstrate that our method achieves a high classification accuracy in an image recognition task with a much smaller number of trainable parameters compared with a previous study.},

To encourage more systematic numerical extrapolation, we propose an architecture that represents numerical quantities as linear activations which are manipulated using primitive arithmetic operators, controlled by learned gates. We call this module a neural arithmetic logic unit (NALU), by analogy to the arithmetic logic unit in traditional processors. Experiments show that NALU-enhanced neural networks can learn to track time, perform arithmetic over images of numbers, translate numerical language into real-valued scalars, execute computer code, and count objects in images. In contrast to conventional architectures, we obtain substantially better generalization both inside and outside of the range of numerical values encountered during training, often extrapolating orders of magnitude beyond trained numerical ranges.},

Compared to state-of-the-art models such as Neural Tensor Network and Holographic Embeddings, our approach based on complex embeddings is arguably simpler, as it only uses the Hermitian dot product, the complex counterpart of the standard dot product between real vectors. Our approach is scalable to large datasets as it remains linear in both space and time, while consistently outperforming alternative approaches on standard link prediction benchmarks.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

The current approach in constructing such agents is to try to include as much variation into training as possible, and then generalize within the possible variations. This paper proposes a principled approach where a context module is coevolved with a skill module. The context module recognizes the variation and modulates the skill module so that the entire system performs well in unseen situations. The approach is evaluated in a challenging version of the Flappy Bird game where the effects of the actions vary over time. The Context+Skill approach leads to significantly more robust behavior in environments with previously unseen effects. Such a principled generalization ability is essential in deploying autonomous agents in real world tasks, and can serve as a foundation for continual learning as well.},

See Fig. 11. 1, p. 30. A. M. Zhabotinskii followed up on Belousov's original observation and in 1964 his first investigations appeared in the Russian journal Biofizika. Though H. Degn (in Copenhagen at the time) knew of Zhabotinskii's work and published his own account of the mechanism of oscillation in Nature (1967), this interesting reaction attracted little attention among Western scientists until 1968, when Zhabotinskii and his coworkers and Busse (from Braunschweig, W. Germany) reported on their work at an international conference on biological and biochemical oscillators held in Prague. Shortly thereafter appeared· a flurry of papers on temporal oscillations and spatial patterns in this reaction system. Vavilin and Zhabotinskii (1969) [and later Kasperek and Bruice (1971)] studied the kinetics of the oxidation 3 of Ce+ by Br0 and the oxidation of organic species by Ce+4. Busse (1969) 3 reported his observation of colored bands of chemical activity propagating up and down in a long tube of unstirred solution. Zaikin and Zhabotinskii (1970) observed circular chemical waves in thin layers of solution.},

Among them, VAEs have the advantage of fast and tractable sampling and easy-to-access encoding networks. However, they are currently outperformed by other models such as normalizing flows and autoregressive models. While the majority of the research in VAEs is focused on the statistical challenges, we explore the orthogonal direction of carefully designing neural architectures for hierarchical VAEs. We propose Nouveau VAE (NVAE), a deep hierarchical VAE built for image generation using depth-wise separable convolutions and batch normalization. NVAE is equipped with a residual parameterization of Normal distributions and its training is stabilized by spectral regularization. We show that NVAE achieves state-of-the-art results among non-autoregressive likelihood-based models on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA HQ datasets and it provides a strong baseline on FFHQ. For example, on CIFAR-10, NVAE pushes the state-of-the-art from 2.98 to 2.91 bits per dimension, and it produces high-quality images on CelebA HQ as shown in Fig. 1. To the best of our knowledge, NVAE is the first successful VAE applied to natural images as large as 256\$\textbackslash times\$256 pixels.},

Thus far, most implementations have been software-based, limiting their speed and power efficiency. Integrated photonics offers the potential for a fast, power efficient and massively parallel hardware implementation. We have previously proposed a network of coupled semiconductor optical amplifiers as an interesting test case for such a hardware implementation. In this paper, we investigate the important design parameters and the consequences of process variations through simulations. We use an isolated word recognition task with babble noise to evaluate the performance of the photonic reservoirs with respect to traditional software reservoir implementations, which are based on leaky hyperbolic tangent functions. Our results show that the use of coherent light in a well-tuned reservoir architecture offers significant performance benefits. The most important design parameters are the delay and the phase shift in the system's physical connections. With optimized values for these parameters, coherent semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) reservoirs can achieve better results than traditional simulated reservoirs. We also show that process variations hardly degrade the performance, but amplifier noise can be detrimental. This effect must therefore be taken into account when designing SOA-based RC implementations.},

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Animals excel at adapting their intentions, attention, and actions to the environment, making them remarkably efficient at interacting with a rich, unpredictable and ever-changing external world, a property that intelligent machines currently lack. Such an adaptation property relies heavily on cellular neuromodulation, the biological mechanism that dynamically controls intrinsic properties of neurons and their response to external stimuli in a context-dependent manner. In this paper, we take inspiration from cellular neuromodulation to construct a new deep neural network architecture that is specifically designed to learn adaptive behaviours. The network adaptation capabilities are tested on navigation benchmarks in a meta-reinforcement learning context and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that neuromodulation is capable of adapting an agent to different tasks and that neuromodulation-based approaches provide a promising way of improving adaptation of artificial systems.},

  abstract = {A challenge in evolutionary robotics is the in parallel adaptation of morphologies and controllers. Here, we considered encoding methods for morphogenesis of 2D virtual creatures that can be created from directed trees. Using an evolutionary algorithm, we optimized locomotion in these virtual creatures and compared a direct encoding, an L-System, and two types of encodings that produce neural networks—a Compositional Pattern Producing Network (CPPN) and a Cellular Encoding (CE). We evaluated these encodings based on performance and diversification, and we introduced an OpenAI gym environment as a computationally inexpensive benchmark for exploring morphological evolution. The direct encoding and L-System generated more fit solutions compared to the network strategies. Considering morphological diversity, the direct encoding finds solutions more locally in the morphological search space, the L-System made larger jumps across this search space, and both network approaches also make larger jumps though find fewer solutions in this space. With these results we show how encodings exhibit different characteristics as developmental approaches. Since the genotype-phenotype mapping plays a major role in evolutionary robotics, further modifications using more complex tasks and environments can lead to a better understanding of morphogenesis and thereby improve how morphologies and controllers of robots are evolved.},

This potential has already been seen by key scientific and industrial groups, with already-impacted application areas including traffic forecasting, drug discovery, social network analysis and recommender systems. Further, some of the most successful domains of application for machine learning in previous years -- images, text and speech processing -- can be seen as special cases of graph representation learning, and consequently there has been significant exchange of information between these areas. The main aim of this short survey is to enable the reader to assimilate the key concepts in the area, and position graph representation learning in a proper context with related fields.},

What distinguishes GLNs from contemporary neural networks is the distributed and local nature of their credit assignment mechanism; each neuron directly predicts the target, forgoing the ability to learn feature representations in favor of rapid online learning. Individual neurons can model nonlinear functions via the use of data-dependent gating in conjunction with online convex optimization. We show that this architecture gives rise to universal learning capabilities in the limit, with effective model capacity increasing as a function of network size in a manner comparable with deep ReLU networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the GLN learning mechanism possesses extraordinary resilience to catastrophic forgetting, performing comparably to a MLP with dropout and Elastic Weight Consolidation on standard benchmarks. These desirable theoretical and empirical properties position GLNs as a complementary technique to contemporary offline deep learning methods.},

There are however other desirable properties of a CL system, such as the ability to transfer knowledge from previous tasks and to scale memory and compute sub-linearly with the number of tasks. Since most current benchmarks focus only on forgetting using short streams of tasks, we first propose a new suite of benchmarks to probe CL algorithms across these new axes. Finally, we introduce a new modular architecture, whose modules represent atomic skills that can be composed to perform a certain task. Learning a task reduces to figuring out which past modules to re-use, and which new modules to instantiate to solve the current task. Our learning algorithm leverages a task-driven prior over the exponential search space of all possible ways to combine modules, enabling efficient learning on long streams of tasks. Our experiments show that this modular architecture and learning algorithm perform competitively on widely used CL benchmarks while yielding superior performance on the more challenging benchmarks we introduce in this work.},

This is behind Big Tech’s unstoppable drive for growth, which leads to monopolisation and enclosure under the winner takes all principle. If we consider AI as a GPT—technologies that alter society’s economic and social structures—we need to come up with alternatives in terms of ownership and governance. The commons is proposed as an alternative for thinking about how to organise AI development and how to distribute the value that can be derived from it. Using the commons framework is also a way of giving society a more prominent role in the debate about what we expect from AI and how we should approach it.},

It can be used for pattern classification, function approximation and other complex tasks.

In this paper we present a case study of the performance of the Liquid State Machine based on a recurrent spiking neural network by applying it to a well known and well studied problem: speech recognition of isolated digits. We evaluate different ways of coding the speech into spike trains. In its optimal configuration, the performance of the LSM approximates that of a state-of-the-art recognition system. Another interesting conclusion is the fact that the biologically most realistic encoding performs far better than more conventional methods.},

We introduce attractor dynamics into an echo state network in a self-organized way by applying a differential Hebbian rule to it’s feedback weights. We find that this yields periodic and quasiperiodic attractors in most cases. We analyse the linearized system after the learning phase to understand the origin of these attractors, and connect these findings to other results concerning the dynamical changes induced by neural plasticity.},

This paper provides such a structured overview, where firstly classifications based on the CA’s rule table are considered, and secondly classifications based on the space–time pattern generated by a CA. The review indicates that most currently available classification schemes are limited to elementary cellular automata and highlights the existing dichotomy in CA research: theoretical research focusing on analytical results from topological dynamics and the theory of computation on the one hand, experimental research focusing on the statistical properties of the simulated space–time patterns on the other hand.},

One can divide that information into two parts: the information accounting for the useful regularity present in the object and the information accounting for the remaining accidental information. There can be several ways (model classes) in which the regularity is expressed. Kolmogorov has proposed the model class of finite sets, generalized later to computable probability mass functions. The resulting theory, known as Algorithmic Statistics, analyzes the algorithmic sufficient statistic when the statistic is restricted to the given model class. However, the most general way to proceed is perhaps to express the useful information as a total recursive function. The resulting measure has been called the "sophistication" of the object. We develop the theory of recursive functions statistic, the maximum and minimum value, the existence of absolutely nonstochastic objects (that have maximal sophistication-all the information in them is meaningful and there is no residual randomness), determine its relation with the more restricted model classes of finite sets, and computable probability distributions, in particular with respect to the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) minimal sufficient statistic, the relation to the halting problem and further algorithmic properties},

  abstract = {To measure how well pretrained representations encode some linguistic property, it is common to use accuracy of a probe, i.e. a classifier trained to predict the property from the representations. Despite widespread adoption of probes, differences in their accuracy fail to adequately reflect differences in representations. For example, they do not substantially favour pretrained representations over randomly initialized ones. Analogously, their accuracy can be similar when probing for genuine linguistic labels and probing for random synthetic tasks. To see reasonable differences in accuracy with respect to these random baselines, previous work had to constrain either the amount of probe training data or its model size. Instead, we propose an alternative to the standard probes, information-theoretic probing with minimum description length (MDL). With MDL probing, training a probe to predict labels is recast as teaching it to effectively transmit the data. Therefore, the measure of interest changes from probe accuracy to the description length of labels given representations. In addition to probe quality, the description length evaluates "the amount of effort" needed to achieve the quality. This amount of effort characterizes either (i) size of a probing model, or (ii) the amount of data needed to achieve the high quality. We consider two methods for estimating MDL which can be easily implemented on top of the standard probing pipelines: variational coding and online coding. We show that these methods agree in results and are more informative and stable than the standard probes.},

  abstract = {Creating open-ended algorithms, which generate their own never-ending stream of novel and appropriately challenging learning opportunities, could help to automate and accelerate progress in machine learning. A recent step in this direction is the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET), an algorithm that generates and solves its own challenges, and allows solutions to goal-switch between challenges to avoid local optima. However, the original POET was unable to demonstrate its full creative potential because of limitations of the algorithm itself and because of external issues including a limited problem space and lack of a universal progress measure. Importantly, both limitations pose impediments not only for POET, but for the pursuit of open-endedness in general. Here we introduce and empirically validate two new innovations to the original algorithm, as well as two external innovations designed to help elucidate its full potential. Together, these four advances enable the most open-ended algorithmic demonstration to date. The algorithmic innovations are (1) a domain-general measure of how meaningfully novel new challenges are, enabling the system to potentially create and solve interesting challenges endlessly, and (2) an efficient heuristic for determining when agents should goal-switch from one problem to another (helping open-ended search better scale). Outside the algorithm itself, to enable a more definitive demonstration of open-endedness, we introduce (3) a novel, more flexible way to encode environmental challenges, and (4) a generic measure of the extent to which a system continues to exhibit open-ended innovation. Enhanced POET produces a diverse range of sophisticated behaviors that solve a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved through other means.},

  abstract = {Knowledge bases (KBs) are often greatly incomplete, necessitating a demand for KB completion. The path ranking algorithm (PRA) is one of the most promising approaches to this task. Previous work on PRA usually follows a single-task learning paradigm, building a prediction model for each relation independently with its own training data. It ignores meaningful associations among certain relations, and might not get enough training data for less frequent relations. This paper proposes a novel multi-task learning framework for PRA, referred to as coupled PRA (CPRA). It first devises an agglomerative clustering strategy to automatically discover relations that are highly correlated to each other, and then employs a multi-task learning strategy to effectively couple the prediction of such relations. As such, CPRA takes into account relation association and enables implicit data sharing among them. We empirically evaluate CPRA on benchmark data created from Freebase. Experimental results show that CPRA can effectively identify coherent clusters in which relations are highly correlated. By further coupling such relations, CPRA significantly outperforms PRA, in terms of both predictive accuracy and model interpretability.},

It can benefit a variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion and relation extraction, and hence has quickly gained massive attention. In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, including not only the state-of-the-arts but also those with latest trends. Particularly, we make the review based on the type of information used in the embedding task. Techniques that conduct embedding using only facts observed in the KG are first introduced. We describe the overall framework, specific model design, typical training procedures, as well as pros and cons of such techniques. After that, we discuss techniques that further incorporate additional information besides facts. We focus specifically on the use of entity types, relation paths, textual descriptions, and logical rules. Finally, we briefly introduce how KG embedding can be applied to and benefit a wide variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion, relation extraction, question answering, and so forth.}

  abstract = {In recent years deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have attained superhuman performance in a number of challenging task domains. However, a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is configured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.},

  abstract = {How can progress in machine learning and reinforcement learning be automated to generate its own never-ending curriculum of challenges without human intervention? The recent emergence of quality diversity (QD) algorithms offers a glimpse of the potential for such continual open-ended invention. For example, novelty search showcases the benefits of explicit novelty pressure, MAP-Elites and Innovation Engines highlight the advantage of explicit elitism within niches in an otherwise divergent process, and minimal criterion coevolution (MCC) reveals that problems and solutions can coevolve divergently. The Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) algorithm introduced in this paper combines these principles to produce a practical approach to generating an endless progression of diverse and increasingly challenging environments while at the same time explicitly optimizing their solutions. An intriguing implication is the opportunity to transfer solutions among environments, reflecting the view that innovation is a circuitous and unpredictable process. POET is tested in a 2-D obstacles course domain, where it generates diverse and sophisticated behaviors that create and solve a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved by direct optimization, or by a direct-path curriculum-building control algorithm. We hope that POET will inspire a new push towards open-ended discovery across many domains.},

Where recurrent neural networks have direct parallels in finite state machines, allowing clear discussion and thought around architecture variants or trained models, Transformers have no such familiar parallel. In this paper we aim to change that, proposing a computational model for the transformer-encoder in the form of a programming language. We map the basic components of a transformer-encoder—attention and feed-forward computation—into simple primitives, around which we form a programming language: the Restricted Access Sequence Processing Language (RASP). We show how RASP can be used to program solutions to tasks that could conceivably be learned by a Transformer, and how a Transformer can be trained to mimic a RASP solution. In particular, we provide RASP programs for histograms, sorting, and Dyck-languages. We further use our model to relate their difficulty in terms of the number of required layers and attention heads: analyzing a RASP program implies a maximum number of heads and layers necessary to encode a task in a transformer. Finally, we see how insights gained from our abstraction might be used to explain phenomena seen in recent works.},

The article contextualizes the emergence of oil futures contracts by narrating the longer history of U.S. futures markets and financialization. It also explores the halting development of oil futures contracts, and analyzes the three kinds of legitimating narratives that accompanied oil futures trading: reason, the primacy of price, and power. As a whole, the article argues that energy crisis discourse contributed significantly to the financialization of the U.S. economy by framing futures markets as the only viable solution to the energy crisis. The much-celebrated oil futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange supported and marked the emergent power of financial thinking as the United States entered a neoliberal era.},

  abstract = {We study the online influence maximization problem in social networks under the independent cascade model. Specifically, we aim to learn the set of “best influencers” in a social network online while repeatedly interacting with it. We address the challenges of (i) combinatorial action space, since the number of feasible influencer sets grows exponentially with the maximum number of influencers, and (ii) limited feedback, since only the influenced portion of the network is observed. Under a stochastic semi-bandit feedback, we propose and analyze IMLinUCB, a computationally efficient UCB-based algorithm. Our bounds on the cumulative regret are polynomial in all quantities of interest, achieve near-optimal dependence on the number of interactions and reflect the topology of the network and the activation probabilities of its edges, thereby giving insights on the problem complexity. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first such results. Our experiments show that in several representative graph topologies, the regret of IMLinUCB scales as suggested by our upper bounds. IMLinUCB permits linear generalization and thus is both statistically and computationally suitable for large-scale problems. Our experiments also show that IMLinUCB with linear generalization can lead to low regret in real-world online influence maximization.},

  abstract = {To efficiently learn from feedback, cortical networks need to update synaptic weights on multiple levels of cortical hierarchy. An effective and well-known algorithm for computing such changes in synaptic weights is the error backpropagation algorithm. However, in this algorithm, the change in synaptic weights is a complex function of weights and activities of neurons not directly connected with the synapse being modified, whereas the changes in biological synapses are determined only by the activity of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Several models have been proposed that approximate the backpropagation algorithm with local synaptic plasticity, but these models require complex external control over the network or relatively complex plasticity rules. Here we show that a network developed in the predictive coding framework can efficiently perform supervised learning fully autonomously, employing only simple local Hebbian plasticity. Furthermore, for certain parameters, the weight change in the predictive coding model converges to that of the backpropagation algorithm. This suggests that it is possible for cortical networks with simple Hebbian synaptic plasticity to implement efficient learning algorithms in which synapses in areas on multiple levels of hierarchy are modified to minimize the error on the output.},

  abstract = {A genetic annealing model for the universal ancestor of all extant life is presented; the name of the model derives from its resemblance to physical annealing. The scenario pictured starts when “genetic temperatures” were very high, cellular entities (progenotes) were very simple, and information processing systems were inaccurate. Initially, both mutation rate and lateral gene transfer levels were elevated. The latter was pandemic and pervasive to the extent that it, not vertical inheritance, defined the evolutionary dynamic. As increasingly complex and precise biological structures and processes evolved, both the mutation rate and the scope and level of lateral gene transfer, i.e., evolutionary temperature, dropped, and the evolutionary dynamic gradually became that characteristic of modern cells. The various subsystems of the cell “crystallized,” i.e., became refractory to lateral gene transfer, at different stages of “cooling,” with the translation apparatus probably crystallizing first. Organismal lineages, and so organisms as we know them, did not exist at these early stages. The universal phylogenetic tree, therefore, is not an organismal tree at its base but gradually becomes one as its peripheral branchings emerge. The universal ancestor is not a discrete entity. It is, rather, a diverse community of cells that survives and evolves as a biological unit. This communal ancestor has a physical history but not a genealogical one. Over time, this ancestor refined into a smaller number of increasingly complex cell types with the ancestors of the three primary groupings of organisms arising as a result.},

Either adding the spin degree of freedom to conventional charge-based electronic devices or using the spin alone has the potential advantages of nonvolatility, increased data processing speed, decreased electric power consumption, and increased integration densities compared with conventional semiconductor devices. To successfully incorporate spins into existing semiconductor technology, one has to resolve technical issues such as efficient injection, transport, control and manipulation, and detection of spin polarization as well as spin-polarized currents. Recent advances in new materials engineering hold the promise of realizing spintronic devices in the near future. We review the current state of the spin-based devices, efforts in new materials fabrication, issues in spin transport, and optical spin manipulation.}

  abstract = {The problem of pattern is considered in terms of how genetic information can be translated in a reliable manner to give specific and different spatial patterns of cellular differentiation. Pattern formation thus differs from molecular differentiation which is mainly concerned with the control of synthesis of specific macromolecules within cells rather than the spatial arrangement of the cells. It is suggested that there may be a universal mechanism whereby the translation of genetic information into spatial patterns of differentiation is achieved. The basis of this is a mechanism whereby the cells in a developing system may have their position specified with respect to one or more points in the system. This specification of position is positional information. Cells which have their positional information specified with respect to the same set of points constitute a field. Positional information largely determines with respect to the cells' genome and developmental history the nature of its molecular differentiation. The specification of positional information in general precedes and is independent of molecular differentiation. The concept of positional information implies a co-ordinate system and polarity is defined as the direction in which positional information is specified or measured. Rules for the specification of positional information and polarity are discussed. Pattern regulation, which is the ability of the system to form the pattern even when parts are removed, or added, and to show size invariance as in the French Flag problem, is largely dependent on the ability of the cells to change their positional information and interpret this change. These concepts are applied in some detail to early sea urchin development, hydroid regeneration, pattern formation in the insect epidermis, and the development of the chick limb. It is concluded that these concepts provide a unifying framework within which a wide variety of patterns formed from fields may be discussed, and give new meaning to classical concepts such as induction, dominance and field. The concepts direct attention towards finding mechanisms whereby position and polarity are specified, and the nature of reference points and boundaries. More specifically, it is suggested that the mechanism is required to specify the position of about 50 cells in a line, relatively reliably, in about 10 hours. The size of embryonic fields is, surprisingly, usually less than 50 cells in any direction.},

A set of sample points is modeled as electrically charged particles on an imaginary 2D plane where they self-organize by movement to minimize the electrostatic force that they each experience. The resulting particles’ positions at equilibrium exhibit an equidistant neighborhood characteristic that fulfills the essential requirement of a quality blue noise point set. We propose to use the Velocity Verlet algorithm commonly used in molecular dynamics simulation as our integration method, and we apply custom adaptation to improve the convergence rate for our purpose. Our method uses the magnitude of electrical charge of particles as an intuitive control parameter of the spectral behavior of the generated blue noise point sets. We are able to obtain high-quality blue noise point sets comparable to the state-of-the-art results, and we have also implemented a simple GPU application to evaluate our method on the image stippling application.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms are often evaluated by measuring and comparing their ability to consistently reach objectives chosen a priori by researchers. Yet recent results from experiments without explicit a priori objectives, such as in Picbreeder and with the novelty search algorithm, raise the question of whether the very act of setting an objective is exacting a subtle price. Nature provides another hint that the reigning objective-based paradigm may be obfuscating evolutionary computation's true potential; after all, many of the greatest discoveries of natural evolution, such as flight and human-level intelligence, were not set as a priori objectives at the beginning of the search. The dangerous question is whether such triumphs only result because they were not objectives. To examine this question, this paper takes the unusual experimental approach of attempting to re-evolve images that were already once evolved on Picbreeder. In effect, images that were originally discovered serendipitously become a priori objectives for a new experiment with the same algorithm. Therefore, the resulting failure to reproduce the very same results cannot be blamed on the evolutionary algorithm, setting the stage for a contemplation of the price we pay for evaluating our algorithms only for their ability to achieve preconceived objectives.},

Rules that support interacting gliders and related complex dynamics can be identified, giving an unlimited source for further study. The distribution of rule classes in rule-space can be shown. A byproduct of the method allows the automatic “filtering” of CA space-time patterns to show up gliders and related emergent configurations more clearly. The classification seems to correspond to our subjective judgment of space-time dynamics. There are also approximate correlations with global measures on convergence in attractor basins, characterized by the distribution of in-degree sizes in their branching structure, and to the rule parameter, Z.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.},

The demand for good forecasting techniques motivates many researchers coming from a wide variety of fields to develop methods for time series prediction. Many of these techniques are very complex to apply and demand lots of computational effort to execute. As an answer to this, we propose the use of Reservoir Computing, a recently developed technique for efficient training of recurrent neural networks, for monthly time series prediction. We will explain how Reservoir Computing in its basic form can be applied to time series prediction. Additionally we will extend this approach with different Reservoir Computing strategies such as seasonal adjustment or a Reservoir Computing based voting collective approach. We will investigate the performance of all the proposed strategies and compare its prediction accuracy with the linear forecasting procedure build in the Census Bureau's X-12-ARIMA program and a Nonlinear Autoregressive model using Least-Squares Support Vector Machines.},

The success of ResNets [11] and DenseNets [16] is due in large part to their innovative wiring plans. Now, neural architecture search (NAS) studies are exploring the joint optimization of wiring and operation types, however, the space of possible wirings is constrained and still driven by manual design despite being searched. In this paper, we explore a more diverse set of connectivity patterns through the lens of randomly wired neural networks. To do this, we first define the concept of a stochastic network generator that encapsulates the entire network generation process. Encapsulation provides a unified view of NAS and randomly wired networks. Then, we use three classical random graph models to generate randomly wired graphs for networks. The results are surprising: several variants of these random generators yield network instances that have competitive accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark. These results suggest that new efforts focusing on designing better network generators may lead to new breakthroughs by exploring less constrained search spaces with more room for novel design.},

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences – a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystro¨mformer – a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystro¨m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystro¨mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystro¨mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard Transformer.

To adapt to local neighborhood properties and tasks, we explore an architecture -- jumping knowledge (JK) networks -- that flexibly leverages, for each node, different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware representation. In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation networks, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, combining the JK framework with models like Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks consistently improves those models' performance.},

We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence.

  abstract = {We examined closely the cerebellar circuit model that we have proposed previously. The model granular layer generates a finite but very long sequence of active neuron populations without recurrence, which is able to represent the passage of time. For all the possible binary patterns fed into mossy fibres, the circuit generates the same number of different sequences of active neuron populations. Model Purkinje cells that receive parallel fiber inputs from neurons in the granular layer learn to stop eliciting spikes at the timing instructed by the arrival of signals from the inferior olive. These functional roles of the granular layer and Purkinje cells are regarded as a liquid state generator and readout neurons, respectively. Thus, the cerebellum that has been considered to date as a biological counterpart of a perceptron is reinterpreted to be a liquid state machine that possesses powerful information processing capability more than a perceptron.},

It is an emerging device in nano technology that provides low power consumption as well as high density. In this paper, the staircase memristor model is discussed and investigated with the HP memristor model. By connecting HP memristor models in series or parallel, a staircase memristor model could be constructed and demonstrate staircase behavior. By comparing the staircase memristor model to the general HP memristor model, distinctions between them are demonstrated and this lends themselves to different applications. Further to the memristor-based cellular neural network (CNN), the structure is modified and applied to the echo state network (ESN) where memristors are used as local connections. By this means, the ESN benefits from the simple structure, non-volatility and low power feature of memristors and therefore the complexity and size of the original ESN architecture can be reduced. Meanwhile, the simpler structure still has satisfactory performance in applications compared with the original ESN.},

  abstract = {A major goal of linguistics and cognitive science is to understand what class of learning systems can acquire natural language. Until recently, the computational requirements of language have been used to argue that learning is impossible without a highly constrained hypothesis space. Here, we describe a learning system that is maximally unconstrained, operating over the space of all computations, and is able to acquire many of the key structures present in natural language from positive evidence alone. We demonstrate this by providing the same learning model with data from 74 distinct formal languages which have been argued to capture key features of language, have been studied in experimental work, or come from an interesting complexity class. The model is able to successfully induce the latent system generating the observed strings from small amounts of evidence in almost all cases, including for regular (e.g.,                                a                 n                              ,                                                                                                                        (                         a                         b                         )                                              n                                                                                       , and                                                                                                                        \{                         a                         ,                         b                         \}                                              +                                                                                       ), context-free (e.g.,                                                                                               a                       n                                                                 b                       n                                          ,                     \,                                            a                       n                                                                 b                                                n                         +                         m                                                                                                              , and                                                                        x                                            x                       R                                                                                       ), and context-sensitive (e.g.,                                                                                               a                       n                                                                 b                       n                                                                 c                       n                                          ,                     \,                                            a                       n                                                                 b                       m                                                                 c                       n                                                                 d                       m                                                                                       , and               xx               ) languages, as well as for many languages studied in learning experiments.

  abstract = {With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.},

  abstract = {Word evolution refers to the changing meanings and associations of words throughout time, as a byproduct of human language evolution. By studying word evolution, we can infer social trends and language constructs over different periods of human history. However, traditional techniques such as word representation learning do not adequately capture the evolving language structure and vocabulary. In this paper, we develop a dynamic statistical model to learn time-aware word vector representation. We propose a model that simultaneously learns time-aware embeddings and solves the resulting “alignment problem”. This model is trained on a crawled NYTimes dataset. Additionally, we develop multiple intuitive evaluation strategies of temporal word embeddings. Our qualitative and quantitative tests indicate that our method not only reliably captures this evolution over time, but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art temporal embedding approaches on both semantic accuracy and alignment quality.},

  abstract = {Convolution is a central operation in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which applies a kernel to overlapping regions shifted across the image. However, because of the strong correlations in real-world image data, convolutional kernels are in effect re-learning redundant data. In this work, we show that this redundancy has made neural network training challenging, and propose network deconvolution, a procedure which optimally removes pixel-wise and channel-wise correlations before the data is fed into each layer. Network deconvolution can be efficiently calculated at a fraction of the computational cost of a convolution layer. We also show that the deconvolution filters in the first layer of the network resemble the center-surround structure found in biological neurons in the visual regions of the brain. Filtering with such kernels results in a sparse representation, a desired property that has been missing in the training of neural networks. Learning from the sparse representation promotes faster convergence and superior results without the use of batch normalization. We apply our network deconvolution operation to 10 modern neural network models by replacing batch normalization within each. Extensive experiments show that the network deconvolution operation is able to deliver performance improvement in all cases on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Cityscapes, and ImageNet datasets.},

During training, only the connections from the reservoir to these output units are learned. A key requisite for output-only training is the echo state property (ESP), which means that the effect of initial conditions should vanish as time passes. In this paper, we use analytical examples to show that a widely used criterion for the ESP, the spectral radius of the weight matrix being smaller than unity, is not sufficient to satisfy the echo state property. We obtain these examples by investigating local bifurcation properties of the standard ESNs. Moreover, we provide new sufficient conditions for the echo state property of standard sigmoid and leaky integrator ESNs. We furthermore suggest an improved technical definition of the echo state property, and discuss what practicians should (and should not) observe when they optimize their reservoirs for specific tasks.},

  abstract = {The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is a popular platform for evaluating reinforcement learning agents. Much of the appeal comes from the fact that Atari games demonstrate aspects of competency we expect from an intelligent agent and are not biased toward any particular solution approach. The challenge of the ALE includes (1) the representation learning problem of extracting pertinent information from raw pixels, and (2) the behavioural learning problem of leveraging complex, delayed associations between actions and rewards. Often, the research questions we are interested in pertain more to the latter, but the representation learning problem adds significant computational expense. We introduce MinAtar, short for miniature Atari, a new set of environments that capture the general mechanics of specific Atari games while simplifying the representational complexity to focus more on the behavioural challenges. MinAtar consists of analogues of five Atari games: Seaquest, Breakout, Asterix, Freeway and Space Invaders. Each MinAtar environment provides the agent with a 10x10xn binary state representation. Each game plays out on a 10x10 grid with n channels corresponding to game-specific objects, such as ball, paddle and brick in the game Breakout. To investigate the behavioural challenges posed by MinAtar, we evaluated a smaller version of the DQN architecture as well as online actor-critic with eligibility traces. With the representation learning problem simplified, we can perform experiments with significantly less computational expense. In our experiments, we use the saved compute time to perform step-size parameter sweeps and more runs than is typical for the ALE. Experiments like this improve reproducibility, and allow us to draw more confident conclusions. We hope that MinAtar can allow researchers to thoroughly investigate behavioural challenges similar to those inherent in the ALE.},

  abstract = {Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having \$O(1)\$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.},

Our main theorem characterizes the permutation invariant functions and provides a family of functions to which any permutation invariant objective function must belong. This family of functions has a special structure which enables us to design a deep network architecture that can operate on sets and which can be deployed on a variety of scenarios including both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks. We also derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for permutation equivariance in deep models. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on population statistic estimation, point cloud classification, set expansion, and outlier detection.},

We explore the issue of local observations of closed systems whose orbits may appear open because of inaccessibility to the global rules governing the overall system. We also investigate aspects of symmetry related to complexity in the distribution of patterns that occur with high frequency in GoL (which we thus call motifs) and analyse the distribution of these motifs with a view to tracking the changes in their algorithmic probability over time. We demonstrate how the tools introduced are an alternative to other computable measures that are unable to capture changes in emergent structures in evolving complex systems that are often too small or too subtle to be properly characterised by methods such as lossless compression and Shannon entropy.},

Using two different measures, Shannon's block entropy and Kolmogorov complexity, the latter approximated by two different methods (lossless compressibility and block decomposition), we arrive at the same trend of larger complex behavioral fractions. We also advance a notion of asymptotic and limit behavior for individual rules, both over initial conditions and runtimes, and we provide a formalization of Wolfram's classification as a limit function in terms of Kolmogorov complexity.},

It helped establish the accepted mathematical concept of randomness, which in turn is the basis of tools that I have developed to justify and quantify what I think is clear evidence of the algorithmic nature of the world. To illustrate the concept I will establish novel upper bounds of algorithmic randomness for elementary cellular automata. I will discuss how the practice of science consists in conceiving a model that starts from certain initial values, running a computable instantiation, and awaiting a result in order to determine where the system may be in a future state—in a shorter time than the time taken by the actual unfolding of the phenomenon in question. If a model does not comply with all or some of these requirements it is traditionally considered useless or even unscientific, so the more precise and faster the better. A model is thus better if it can explain more with less, which is at the core of Chaitin’s ”compression is comprehension”. I will pursue these questions related to the random versus possibly algorithmic nature of the world in two directions, drawing heavily on the work of Chaitin. I will also discuss how the algorithmic approach is related to the success of science at producing models of the world, allowing computer simulations to better understand it and make more accurate predictions and interventions.},

How is it that some of these approaches have (apparently) been successfully applied? We explore recent attempts to adopt more powerful, albeit more difficult methods, methods based on the theories of computability and algorithmic probability, which may eventually display and grasp these higher level elements of human intelligence. We propose that a fundamental question in science regarding how to find shortcuts for faster adoption of proven mathematical tools can be answered by shortening the adoption cycle and leaving behind old practices in favour of new ones. This is the case for randomness, where science continues to cling to purely statistical tools in disentangling randomness from meaning, and is stuck in a self-deluding pattern of still privileging regression and correlation despite the fact that mathematics has made important advances to better characterise randomness that have yet to be incorporated into scientific theory and practice.},

The technique is interesting because it provides a natural algorithmic process for symmetry breaking generating complex n-dimensional structures from perfectly symmetric and fully deterministic computational rules producing a distribution of patterns as described by algorithmic probability. Algorithmic probability also elegantly connects the frequency of occurrence of a pattern with its algorithmic complexity, hence effectively providing estimations to the complexity of the generated patterns. Experiments to validate estimations of algorithmic complexity based on these concepts are presented, showing that the measure is stable in the face of some changes in computational formalism and that results are in agreement with the results obtained using lossless compression algorithms when both methods overlap in their range of applicability. We then use the output frequency of the set of 2-dimensional Turing machines to classify the algorithmic complexity of the space-time evolutions of Elementary Cellular Automata.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to propose an alternative behavioural definition of computation (and of a computer) based simply on whether a system is capable of reacting to the environment—the input—as reflected in a measure of programmability. This definition is intended to have relevance beyond the realm of digital computers, particularly vis-à-vis natural systems. This will be done by using an extension of a phase transition coefficient previously defined in an attempt to characterise the dynamical behaviour of cellular automata and other systems. The transition coefficient measures the sensitivity of a system to external stimuli and will be used to define the susceptibility of a system to be (efficiently) programmed.},

  abstract = {We introduce Attention Free Transformer (AFT), an efficient variant of Transformers [1] that eliminates the need for dot product self attention. In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.},

DeepDive programs are declarative in that one cannot write proba-bilistic inference algorithms; instead, one interacts by defining fea-tures or rules about the domain. A key reason for this design choice is to enable domain experts to build their own KBC systems. We present the applications, abstractions, and techniques of DeepDive employed to accelerate construction of KBC systems.},

However, the existing pre-trained language models rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured knowledge facts for better language understanding. We argue that informative entities in KGs can enhance language representation with external knowledge. In this paper, we utilize both large-scale textual corpora and KGs to train an enhanced language representation model (ERNIE), which can take full advantage of lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information simultaneously. The experimental results have demonstrated that ERNIE achieves significant improvements on various knowledge-driven tasks, and meanwhile is comparable with the state-of-the-art model BERT on other common NLP tasks.

In the second stage, based on the resulting architecture and weights of an ANN, Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) backpropagation algorithm is adopted for fine-tuning ANN weights. The performance of the two-stage approach has been evaluated on several benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the two-stage approach can fast produce compact ANNs with good generalization ability at low computational cost.},

In this work, we propose pre-training large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on massive text corpora with a new self-supervised objective. In PEGASUS, important sentences are removed/masked from an input document and are generated together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences, similar to an extractive summary. We evaluated our best PEGASUS model on 12 downstream summarization tasks spanning news, science, stories, instructions, emails, patents, and legislative bills. Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 12 downstream datasets measured by ROUGE scores. Our model also shows surprising performance on low-resource summarization, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results on 6 datasets with only 1000 examples. Finally we validated our results using human evaluation and show that our model summaries achieve human performance on multiple datasets.},

Traditional convolutional GANs generate high-resolution details as a function of only spatially local points in lower-resolution feature maps. In SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations. Moreover, the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore, recent work has shown that generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we apply spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training dynamics. The proposed SAGAN achieves the state-of-the-art results, boosting the best published Inception score from 36.8 to 52.52 and reducing Frechet Inception distance from 27.62 to 18.65 on the challenging ImageNet dataset. Visualization of the attention layers shows that the generator leverages neighborhoods that correspond to object shapes rather than local regions of fixed shape.},

However, these models require practitioners to specify an exact model architecture and set accompanying hyperparameters, including the filter region size, regularization parameters, and so on. It is currently unknown how sensitive model performance is to changes in these configurations for the task of sentence classification. We thus conduct a sensitivity analysis of one-layer CNNs to explore the effect of architecture components on model performance; our aim is to distinguish between important and comparatively inconsequential design decisions for sentence classification. We focus on one-layer CNNs (to the exclusion of more complex models) due to their comparative simplicity and strong empirical performance, which makes it a modern standard baseline method akin to Support Vector Machine (SVMs) and logistic regression. We derive practical advice from our extensive empirical results for those interested in getting the most out of CNNs for sentence classification in real world settings.},

However, most usable network architectures are hand-crafted and usually require expertise and elaborate design. In this paper, we provide a block-wise network generation pipeline called BlockQNN which automatically builds high-performance networks using the Q-Learning paradigm with epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. The optimal network block is constructed by the learning agent which is trained to choose component layers sequentially. We stack the block to construct the whole auto-generated network. To accelerate the generation process, we also propose a distributed asynchronous framework and an early stop strategy. The block-wise generation brings unique advantages: (1) it yields state-of-the-art results in comparison to the hand-crafted networks on image classification, particularly, the best network generated by BlockQNN achieves 2.35\% top-1 error rate on CIFAR-10. (2) it offers tremendous reduction of the search space in designing networks, spending only 3 days with 32 GPUs. A faster version can yield a comparable result with only 1 GPU in 20 hours. (3) it has strong generalizability in that the network built on CIFAR also performs well on the larger-scale dataset. The best network achieves very competitive accuracy of 82.0\% top-1 and 96.0\% top-5 on ImageNet.},

  abstract = {Developing neural network image classification models often requires significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we study a method to learn the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new search space (the "NASNet search space") which enables transferability. In our experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or "cell") on the CIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a convolutional architecture, named "NASNet architecture". We also introduce a new regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly improves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, NASNet achieves 2.4\% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. On ImageNet, NASNet achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7\% top-1 and 96.2\% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2\% better in top-1 accuracy than the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS - a reduction of 28\% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of NASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For instance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74\% top-1 accuracy, which is 3.1\% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. Finally, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0\% achieving 43.1\% mAP on the COCO dataset.},

  abstract = {Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many difficult learning tasks in image, speech and natural language understanding. Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.},
